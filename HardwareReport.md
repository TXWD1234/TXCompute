## 2026-04-08 19:39:15:<br>Category: KiCad<br>Topic: The absolute beginning steps
### 1. Controls:
- `A`: add symbol
- `V`: set value
- `F`: set footprint (The pysical size, usually use `Capacitor_THT:C_Disc_D5.0mm_W2.5mm_P2.50mm`)
- `W`: wiring tool - can also be done by just clicking on the nodes. *(Just like Endfield)*
### 2. The Microprocessor
Microprocessor is also called MCU, which is the core of the entire hardware project.
*The MCU I am currently using is `ESP32`, the specific version is `ESP32-S3-WROOM-1`.*
There are 5 core parts of the MCU as far as i undertsand:
- 3V3: the power source, that has 3.3V of voltage
- GND: the ground
- EN
- TXD0 / RXD0
- IO ports
### where to start
1. press A, and search esp32, find `ESP32-S3-WROOM-1`, double click and put it somewhere in the schematic
2. press A again and search `3V3`, find it and place it at the top of the `esp32`. don't wire yet. do the same thing with `GND` but at the bottom.
3. Connet the `3v3` symbol to the 3v3 port of `esp32`, and do the same thing for `GND`.

## 2026-04-08 20:06:45:<br>Category: PCB Structure<br>Topic: Decoupling capacitors
Decoupling capacitors minimize the vibration of the eletric current. (since them change every nanosecond)
It's two capacitors in parallel that connects the 3v3 line and the GND line.
One of them is set to `0.1uf` for handling small vibration, and another is set to `10.0uf` to handle large, slow power changes.
*how to change value: hover you mouse on the symbol, and press F.*

## 2026-04-08 21:37:44:<br>Category: KiCad<br>Topic: Symbol, Reference and Value
*Symbol is like a class or type in C++.* it's a component to create a project - It is the component that compose of a project.
Symbols are the representation of real world hardware components.
Reference is the name / unique identifier of a symbol. Each individual symbol will have a reference. *It's like the variable name in C++.*
Value is the attributes of a symbol object, that defines the behavior of that particular object.

## 2026-04-09 15:31:05:<br>Category: PCB Structure<br>Topic: I2C
I2C("I square C" / Inter-Integrated Circuit / IIC) is the protocol of hardware components communicating.
I2C defines that there will be 2 lines in the communication system: SDA (Data line / Signal Data) and SCL (Clock line / Signal Clock).
By the default state, each line will be in high state.
When a device attempt to send a signal (a message), first it pull the state of both lines into low. That indicates a signal is trying to be sent.
Then, for the rest of the message, the SCL will keep doing a high-low-high-low loop. Each state change of the SCL indicates that a bit on the SDA is being sent.
In sync with SCL, the SDA will send one bit for each clock state change.
In the beginning of the message, the SDA will have a stride of data reserved for the metadata (attributes) of the message. Things like the receiver will be contained in there.
Then proceed will be the actuall bit data in the message. For each 8 bit (one byte), a ACK (Acknowledge) bit will be sent by the receiver, indicating that it received the data correctly. A low bit indicates `ok`, and a high bit indicates `error` or `eof`.

### Note for ESP32
In ESP32, which pin will be associating with which need to be explicitly setted in code, by calling a function.

## 2026-04-09 15:23:43:<br>Category: PCB Structure<br>Topic: Pull up
Signals in hardware are just high and low voltages. 0V is low (representing 0), and anything above that is high (representing 1).
When not powered, a wire is low by default (because obviously it don't have any power, so it don;t have any electricity). But in I2C, the default state should be high.
Because when the wire is low, it would catch any signals that are higher then 0, and that will cause a state change. Which, would happen a lot since the hardware have a lot of noise.
Therefore, we need to set the wire to have a default high voltage, and then whatever voltage change expect droping to 0, will still result a high (1) state.

### Implementing Pull up
Pull up is essentially powering the two signal lines: SDA and SCL. And to power a line, all the action need to be done is just connect it to the power source: VCC / 3V3.
To merely achieve Pull up, just connect the power source with the signal lines will do it.
But 3V3 have too many power, not only the noise will be blocked, it would also block the signals from the ESP32. And the signal lines will always stay high.
Therefore, we need to add resistors to reduce the voltage of the 3V3, such that the voltage would be strong enough to block the noises, while week enough to let the signals from the ESP32.
*And that specific number of resistance is 4.7k Ohms.*

## 2026-04-09 16:07:09:<br>Category: KiCad<br>Topic: Net Labels
Net labels in KiCad is like the teleporting points. It's endpoint of lines, and each net label object is connected.
Net labels can be created by pressing `L` key, and enter the name. net labels with same name will be connected.
By using net labels, the schemantic can be organized very cleanly.

## 2026-04-09 19:41:14:<br>Category: KiCad<br>Topic: The nature of Power symbols
The power symbol you place, such as `VCC` and `GND` are not repersenting physical components, instead they are purely just a net label;
What they actually are have almost no difference then the net labels we placed.
They also connect together like teleporting.
The only difference of them between Net Labels is that they are global, which means they work everywhere, even on different pages they still are connected together.

### VCC vs GND
Usually `VCC` is created uninitialized. You need to initialized it by yourself.
But GND usually don't require an initialization.

## 2026-04-09 19:10:13:<br>Category: PCB Structure<br>Topic: LDO (Linear Regulator)
Because USB provide the power of 5V, and ESP32 accept 3.3V, connecting the USB directly on ESP32 will destory the chip.
Therefore, a voltage converter need to be placed in the middle.
And that's what called a LDO (Linear Regulator).
The common type of LDO, *and what I used* is `AMS1117-3.3`.

### **Important Notes:**
**Both the input and the output of the LDO need a capacitor of `10uf`.**

## 2026-04-09 19:11:46:<br>Category: Personal Journal<br>Topic: The first refactor
As I LDOs, and since I organized my schemantic into boxes and areas, I need to refactor the VCC area.
And what that means is that my first Hardware refactor had came!
THE PAIN, HAD ONLY BEGAN....

## 2026-04-09 19:17:20:<br>Category: PCB Struture<br>Topic: VBUS - USB Interface
*This is a big thing, get ready. —— TX_Jerry*
Remember the VCC initialization thing we memtioned before (in `# The nature of Power symbols`)? well this is the thing that initializes it.
It's basically allowing using USB cable connection to power the PCB.

### VBUS
VBUS (USB Bus Voltage) is the same concept as a power label: it's a Net Label, that represent a concept instead of a actual physical component.
VBUS is basically the power supply from the USB.

### USB-C Input Receptacle
When you have an USE-C cable and you want to use it to power something, the first thing you are looking for is definitely the plug slot or socket for the cable, right?
*That "plug slot" or "socket" is called **"Receptacle** in Hardware.*
And to use USB to power our own PCB, we need one of those receptacle too.
And that's the `USB_C_Receptacle`. *(or simpler version, which is more recommanded for beginners: `USB_C_Receptacle_USB2.0_0_14P`)*
These are the pins on the `USB_C_Receptacle_USB2.0_0_14P`:
- `SHIELD`: connects to `GND`
- `GND`: connects to `GND`
- `D+` / `D-`: connects to `D+` / `D-` on the `ESP32`. **Note that there are 2 `D+` / `D-` each? connect the 2 `D+` together; same for `D-`. This exist because USB-C works for both ways you plug it in, so you need to enable both of them to ensure that machnisum works.**
- `CC1` / `CC2`: connects to GND, with a `5.1k` resistor each
- `VBUS`: connects to the `VBUS` label

### Linear Regulator
Linear Regulator / Voltage Regulator (LDO) is... wait I've already talked about this before. Go read `LDO (Linear Regulator)` if you haven't already.

### The whole picture
First it's `USE_C_Receptable`, which have a `GND` connecting to `GND` Label, 2 `CC` connecting to `GND` Label, each with a `5.1k` resistor, and a `VBUS` connecting to the `VBUS` label; and then there's `AMS1117-3.3`, which have `VBUS` Label as it's input, with a `10uf` capacitior, and then output to `VCC` Label with another `10uf` capacitor, and also a `GND` that connects to `GND` Label. 

## 2026-04-09 19:53:24:<br>Category: Practical Knowledge<br>Topic: The Capacitors
Capacitors are like buffers, not the memory buffer, but literally buffers that buff the overflowing or vibrating electricity.
As you know, hardware and electricity is unstable. They always change. Therefore to get the stable source of electricity, we need buffers to handle those overflowing IO.
Hense, that's why capacitors need to exist everywhere - because they are the "door holders" in the electricity world.

# 2026-04-10

## 2026-04-09 22:31:28:<br>Category: Bug Report<br>Topic: Capacitor placement
**Capacitors need to be connected in parallel, but not in serie!**
The top of the capacitor need to connect with the line it's attaching with, and the bottom need to connect with the `GND`.

## 2026-04-10 16:01:49:<br>Category: KiCad<br>Topic: Buttons and switches
In KiCad, a switch have a `SW_` prefix.
One common type of switches is: `SW_Push`. It's just a simple push button that makes a complete circuit when pressed.

## 2026-04-10 16:09:43:<br>Category: PCB Structure<br>Topic: The boot setup - EN and IO0
The booting setup of the ESP have 2 things: EN - the overall power toggle, and IO0 - the debug/release toggle.

### EN
`EN` is the overall power toggle. When EN is low (powered off), the entire MCU will be powered down.
Switching EN from high to low then to high is called a *"reset"* operation - basically just power off then on. It would clear out the RAM, and run the boot process again.

### IO0
`IO0` is the toggle between `Download` mode and `Running` mode.
When `IO0` is low, the ESP32 is in the `Download` mode, which the data from the computer, connecting to the ESP32 with an USB wire to the USB socket on the ESP32, will be able to be *flashed* into the hard drive of the ESP32.
When `IO0` is high, the ESP32 will be in `Running` mode, where the program you wrote and uploaded will be directly executed as soon as it turned high.

### Implementation
1. connect the `EN` pin from the `ESP32` to `VCC` with a `10k` resistor between.
2. connect the `EN` pin to the `GND`, with a push button (`SW_Push`) between it, that allow you to toggle the state.
3. do the same thing for `IO0`

### **Note for using the dev board**
When using the dev board, the implementation of this part is already included in the board.
It appears as 2 buttons on the dev board labeled `EN` and `BOOT`, that acts exactly like the push buttons you placed.
Therefore, no need for double implementation, you can just use the buttons they provided.

## 2026-04-10 18:24:23:<br>Category: Development Knowledge<br>Topic: How the program in ESP32 (embeded system) is executed
Inside ESP32, there's a big flash memory.
That flash memory is the "Hard drive" of the ESP32.
And the program you wrote, and compiled is store in this memory.

---
When you powered up your ESP32: high your `EN`, it would first look at the `IO0` and check if it's high.
If `IO0` is low, it would jump to the download mode handler (it's a built-in firmware) and wait for you data to be transfered.
if `IO0` is high, it would jump directly to the binary program you uploaded, and start execute it from it's entry point.
*In normal desktop applications, running a program would require it to be load into the RAM,* But in embedded system, it would be executed directly from the flashed disk, and instruction by instruction until the final return of the main function.

---
ESP32 do have a heap, but it's size is limited, it's only 512KB. Which means, you have to care about fragmentation and memory managament more now, since if you exceed the memory limit, it will not only be a segmentation fault, but a straight crash of the program.

## 2026-04-10 19:06:59:<br>Category: Personal Journal<br>Topic: The "dev board or not" struggle
I was once had the idea to make a calculator from the logic gates. And that was the original idea of this project.
But at that point i have completely no idea what everything looks like, so i was just dreaming.
When i actually started researching, i found out very soon that the time and money only allow a project that have the complexity starting from MCUs.
So i decided to use MCU, and now im deciding weither i should use dev board or not.
*Building from scratch* was always what i am going for, and i enjoyed it. But cleaerly we don't have the time for that.
Especially with the high cost of testing and developing for hardware, it's a very harsh development environment, where a tiny mistake can burn the entire thing down, I don't have the time to build from scratch this time.
Therefore, Even though I want to, I don't *dare* to try it.

## 2026-04-11 13:26:42:<br>Category: Development report<br>Topic: Installing ESP-IDF - the ESP IDE
In order to program the ESP32, some specific operations need to be done.
First, you need to compile you C++ code with a specific cross-compiler for the embedded system of ESP32.
Second, you need to copy you built binary to the specific location inside the ESP32 chip. The bootloader will only look at there for binary instructions to execute.
And there's an entire IDE to do that, and that's **ESP_IDF**.

### Installation
Install the extension ESP-IDF in your VSCode, and follow it's notification to the EIM (ESP-IDF Installation Manager), and click install. *(at least that's how i did it)*

---
Note: after installation, the the default path of it will be inside `~/.espressif`.
The ESP_IDF can be found in `~/.espressif/v6.0/esp-idf`.
The EIM executable could be found in `~/.espressif/eim_gui/eim` in case you want to reinstall.

## 2026-04-11 16:52:22:<br>Category: Hardware Programming<br>Topic: ESP-IDF project setup
### Create a ESP-IDF Project
The ESP-IDF extension serves a specific type of project: "The ESP-IDF project".
The extension will only be activated once it detected that it's a ESP-IDF project.
The one attribute a project have that makes it qualify as a ESP-IDF project is that:
**It has a `CMakeLists.txt`, and inside that `CMakeLists.txt` there is the presence of this line:**
**`include($ENV{IDF_PATH}/tools/cmake/project.cmake)`**

---
To create a ESP-IDF project, press Ctrl+Shift+P and search: `ESP-IDF: Create New Empty Project`.
Enter the name of the project and choose it's path.

#### check if the extension is activated
if there's a long row of options at the bottom bar, including "ESP-IDF v6.0.0"(or whatever version you have), and some kind of a chip model such as "exp32", then the extension is activated.

### Configure the project
*"Configure" here means literally configuring it, not the CMake Configure state.*
There are a few setups need to be done before the project is eligible to build.

#### The Device Target (The chip model)
On the bottom bar, there is a chip model displaying.
The default model is `esp32`. But you might want to set it as a different model.
Click on it to set the model.
*select the first configuration(`USB_JTAG`) if it asked after you selected the model.* 

#### The CMakeLists.txt
In the most outer CMakeLists.txt (the one in the project directory), there is the magic line that identified this project is a ESP_IDF project:
`include($ENV{IDF_PATH}/tools/cmake/project.cmake)`
But `$ENV{IDF_PATH}` remains empty and uninitializaed. *For some reason that value is not setted in the config files or by their configuration tools.*
So you have to manually initiallize the variable `$ENV{IDF_PATH}`. For example:
`set(ENV{IDF_PATH} /home/TX_Jerry/.espressif/v6.0/esp-idf)`

### Use CMake to build the project
For the ESP-IDF project to successfully build, it requires some environment variables.
And if you directly build from VSCode, it won't have those variables, since VSCode is just calling `cmake --build ./build`, it won't know to set the variables.
*You could try edit the config files to make VSCode set those variables, but i just never got them to work.*
Therefore, we need to use the command line to build the project first **once**, and then in the future we would rely on incremental build, and won't have to build the already built files that requires environment variavbles again.

#### grant command line the env vars
Inside the ESP_IDF dir (usually in `~/.espressif/v6.0/esp-idf`), there are 2 sets of multi-platform scripts: `install` and `export`.
*use `install` to ensure you have everything installed.*
And `export` does the exact task of giving the env vars to the command line.
**But because directly running the script will create a new process, and the variable will be given to that process, and the process you ran the script on will not have the env vars, you must run the script with a `.` before it, to make the env vars apply to current process.**
**Example:**
```bash
. ./"export.sh"
```

#### Build with CMake
After you have the evnv vars, you can create a `build` dir in your project files, and do the classic CMake build operations:
```bash
mkdir build; cd build
cmake -G Ninja -S ..
cmake --build .
```
And after it's completed with no errors, you should see a `<youProjectName>.elf` and a `<youProjectName>.bin` file in the build directory.

---
And now, you can go back to VSCode. and if you press F7 or click build now, it would not have problem with the environment variables.

## 2026-04-12 13:42:32:<br>Category: Hardware Programming<br>Topic: ESP-IDF's CMake
*ESP_IDF wrappes CMake so heavily, it's almost a completely different system.*
*The ESP-IDF's CMake system rely heavily on hardcoding file names and dir names, and they propose "convention more then configuration", therefore you cannot really customize the workflow.*
*The ESP-IDF is built targeting C, though it 100% supports C++, it still requires some extra setup for it to work properly.*
ESP-IDF have a unique "component based" system. It treat every folder with a CMakeLists.txt with the line:
```c
idf_component_register(...)
```
as a "component". The concept of a component can just be analogized as target in CMake.
The registered name of a component is not defined in the function `idf_component_register`. Instead, it's defined as the folder / dir name that the CMakeLists.txt exists(the parent dir name of the CMakeLists.txt).

#### `idf_component_register(SRCS <srcN> ... INCLUDE_DIRS <dirN> ... REQUIRES <componentN> ...)`
The basic syntax of the function `idf_component_register` has 3 parameters:
- `SRCS`: The source files contained in this component. CMake Analogy: the `<src>` part of `add_executable(name <src>)`
- `INCLUDE_DIRS`: The internal AND external include dir of the component. CMake Analogy: `target_include_directories(name PUBLIC <dirs>)`
- `REQUIRES`: The prerequisite or dependency of the current component. write component name with `""` here. CMake Analogy: `target_link_libraries(name PUBLIC <libs>)`

### The main entry
Unfortunatly, the ESP-IDF's CMake force you to hae a `main` component, and it would ONLY look for a `main` component for entry point.
*So like, this thing is all just hard coding...*
Further, since ESP-IDF have it's own compiler, it make the entry function from `mian()` to `app_main()`.
And be because it's targeting to C functions, you have to write `extern "C"`:
```cpp
extern "C" void app_main(void) {}
```

## 2026-04-12 19:05:56:<br>Category: Development report<br>Topic: How to find a suitable part
*https://www.lcsc.com/ is the professional website for purchasing electricity parts.*
First, determind the requirements.
For example, today when I was trying to find a model for my screen, I first determinded the dimension of the screen, and then which protocol it will use.
When I had a clear idea about what I would buy, I went to searching. Through research, I found the website `ICSC`, which is the professional platform to buy parts.
During the process of searching on it, I found out that electricity parts are actually cheaper then I thought.
And a also found a very useful stratagy:
**Look at the datasheet provided.**
It always contains very useful informations, and often helps a lot.
*(why did i feel like this is the most boring report i ever wrote?)*

## 2026-04-12 19:16:48:<br>Category: PCB Structure<br>Topic: The Graphics Pipeline
Since in hardware, or specificly, in embeded system such as ESP32, we don't get a GPU or a very big RAM.
Therefore, we have to shrink the size of the screen to fit it in the tiny computation power and memory capacity of ESP32.
The most common size of screens are 320x240 and 480x320. *which is absolute tiny comparing to modern technologies.*

### the Framebuffer layout
Since we don't have a GPU,*we are no longer drawing triangles,* we have to create the final frame buffer (raw screen pixel data) by ourself, or more accurately, by the CPU.
Further, since we don't have a very big RAM, the pixels cannot be fully 32bit RGBA colors.
The most common why to store the raw pixels is the RGB565 protocol (aka 16bit RGB).
It have 5 bit each for Red and Blue, and 6 bit for Green *because science tells you that human eyes are more sensitive for color green then the other 2 colors.*
you will be managing you own buffer, and use an API to draw.

### the PCB Connection
Between the screen and the ESP32, there are exactly 13 connections / lines for the 8-bit parallel data bus, which is the most optimal solution for a screen on ESP32.
8 of them (D0 ~ D7) are for direct data transfer. Which each of them is one bit, and together they send 1 byte each pulse, and each pixel will take 2 pulse.
and the rest 5 are controls:
- CS (Chip select) is the *"Attention Pin"*. It indicates the specific device (in this case, the screen) is listening if it's low. If CS is high, it will **ignore** all the data on the data lines.
- RSDC (Register Select / Draw Command) or DC (Data / Command) is the *"mode selector"*. It indicates the next byte is an instruction if it's low, and the next byte is a pixel data if it's high. *But this pin cannot be high for all the times. during specific phases of rendering, it need to be low and some commands need to be sent.*
- WR (Write) is the write clock for the 8 bit data bus. it will go high and low very frequently. In fact, the faster it swaps between high and low will determind how fase the data bus is. Because each pulse (it goes low and back high: 2 state changes) will triger the device to fetch the data once.
- RD (Read) is the read clock. Basically, since we never read from the screen, it's always tied high (Pulled up).
- RST (Reset) will reset the screen from hardware. It's usually used before everything, duing init time.
And there are also the VCC and GND pins, which results a total of 15 pins from the screen, and the allocation of 12 GPIO pins(VCC, GND and RD are excluded).

### The full pipeline
To draw a pixel on the screen: (a draw call1)
1. CS goes LOW (Hey screen, listen up!)
2. RS/DC goes HIGH (I'm sending pixel data, not a command.)
3. D0-D7 bits are set to the first half of the green color.
4. WR pulses LOW → HIGH (Screen grabs the first 8 bits).
5. D0-D7 bits are set to the second half of the green color.
6. WR pulses LOW → HIGH (Screen grabs the second 8 bits).
7. CS goes HIGH (I'm done for now).

## 2026-04-13 21:24:36:<br>Category: Hardware Programming<br>Topic: Fixing the damn ESP-IDF CMake system - make it compatible with standard CMake libraries
*Because ESP-IDF have it's own CMake wrapper system, it's not compatible with other CMake libraries. And I HATE that so much.*
In order to fix this problem, the easiest way is to use the fundamental standard CMake system to link the libraries.

### The fundational structure of ESP-IDF's CMake system
In ESP-IDF's CMake system, targets are abstarted into "components".
And each component, basically wraps a CMake library target.
And at build time, all of those libraries will be linked to an internal executable, including the `main` component.
*Actually, it's the `main` component will be linked to the internal executable, and everything will be linked to the `main` component.*
And since a component contains a project, we can just make a component that links to the library. And then the entire thing will be connected with the ESP-IDF's CMake system.

### Making the "Umbrella Component"
*It's actually pretty staright forward.*
Since a ESP-IDF component have an internal CMake library target, we can just use the standard CMake way to link our libraries to the underlying CMake target directly.

#### `${COMPONENT_LIB}`
Huge thanks to who ever decide to add this entry, it's a direct access to the underlying target of a component in the component's CMakeLists.txt.
Yes, this variable literally represents the underlying target of a ESP-IDF component.

#### Linking the library
Since we have access to a CMake target, everything become so much easier, we can just do this:
```c
add_subdirectory("${TXLib}")
target_link_libraries(${COMPONENT_LIB} INTERFACE
	TXMath
)
```
But also, we need to register the component in order to access it's underlying target (basically defining the target).
We usually do that after the `add_subdirectory()`:
```c
add_subdirectory("${TXLib}")
idf_component_register()
target_link_libraries(${COMPONENT_LIB} INTERFACE
	TXMath
)
```

#### The Script phase pitfall
The ESP-IDF CMake system runs the CMakeLists.txt multiple times.
Sometimes it would be some specific mode, that forbidden some operations, such as the `SCRIPT_MODE`.
So make sure to wrap the include code in `if (!isScriptMode)`, but in CMake... hehe.
```c
if(NOT CMAKE_SCRIPT_MODE_FILE)
	add_subdirectory("${TXLib}")
endif()

idf_component_register()

if(NOT CMAKE_SCRIPT_MODE_FILE)
	target_link_libraries(${COMPONENT_LIB} INTERFACE
		TXMath
	)
endif()
```

## 2026-04-14 21:55:54:<br>Category: Personal Report<br>Topic: Stage report
When I get more into the ESP-IDF development system, I got less passionated about the hardware programming part.
Purely becauset the in convinency and the lack of discipline for the IDE.
For something like OpenGL, even it do have very bad API design, it's wrappable, I can make beautiful API on top of it.
But ESP-IDF is the IDE itself, and I got no way to wrap or fix it.
The only thing i can do it to work around it or cheese or hack it.
Whatever way, it's not the most elegant way of doing it.
I would put the API design of ESP-IDF as a bad design.
But still, i am relying on it, since it's almost the only thing i can use to create ESP projects.
I've thought of switching to someting like Raspberry Pi, but it's way too complicated and **expensive**.
As to today, I've started learning hardware for 6 days. And all of them are centered around ESP32.
I don't want to change it mid way, not only because the reason above, more importantly:
**I just need to make the project. and how i can achieve it is not in consideration.**
Hardware is not like software, where i can build libraries and learn libraries and use it over and over again.
In hardware, one chip is one chip, you cannot reuse a chip in different projects.
**It's not reproducable.**
So the chance for me to change the chip type for next time will be very high, almost certain, but for this time, there's no time and necessarity to change it.

---
And these two days, I've been dealing with CMake and ESP-IDF to make the development environment "usable".
I have some problem remaining, waiting for me to fix, but the major problems are conquered.
I think I can be back to production by the end of tomorrow.
And then, it's just learning the Software APIs, and wrap them —— which I am pretty good at.
But for now, I'll say: Good night! 

# 2026-04-15

## 2026-04-15 20:15:23:<br>Category: Hardware Programming<br>Topic: The ESP-IDF include system
*In old tutorials, it often says to use the `driver` component. But in modern ESP, we have splited the giant driver component into multiple components.*
*Since CMake don't have Intellisense or suggestions (damn it!), you can see the components list in `"~/.espressif/v6.0/esp-idf/components/"`*

In ESP-IDF, components are like CMake libraries, you include, or `REQUIRES` them when declaring a component (via `idf_component_register`).
After `REQUIRES`ed the component, you then can include the headers inside them.
**Attension, when including in source code, remember to put the component name before the path, as a parent directory.**

### Some common components and headers
| Component | Headers |
|-|-|
`esp_driver_gpio` | `"driver/gpio.h"`
`esp_timer`       | `"esp_timer.h"`
`esp_system`      | `"esp_heap_caps.h"`

*Notice: ESP-IDF also have the recursive inclusion thing, since everything is public, the child component will have everything the parent component have. Therefore even if you didn't include some component explicitly, you might still be able to use them.*

# 2026-04-16

## 2026-04-16 21:09:27:<br>Category: Hardware Programming<br>Topic: The General Pipeline Overview
The ESP32 API set have 3 major "Component" *(not the actual ESP-IDF component, but literally components)*:
- GPIO control
- Hardware Peripherals
- Heap / Memory management
- Communication / Protocols
And a bunch of utility components, such as `esp_timer`.

### GPIO control
It's just controlling the GPIO pins to switch between 0 and 1, and also read what it is currently.
It's the fundamental backbone of the ESP32's communication system.
The GPIO is the most low level software control over the silicon signals.
It's often wrapped heavily by other components and high level APIs such as `esp_lcd`.
Therefore normally for common usage you won't need to touch GPIO APIs.
But as if you want any specifc or customized protocol that's not a common protocol, you would need to use the fundational APIs - the GPIO APIs.

### Hardware Peripherals
**Silicon Magic.** They are some specifc hardcoded curcuits in the chip that perform specific tasks.
They consist:
- timer
- I2C
- SPI
They utilize the GPIO pins and process the data the user gives them, and do the job faster then software.
*Instead of CPU doing everything, there are some very common functions was made into silicon magic, so they are ultra fast, and everyone uses it.*

### Heap management
In the world of ESP32, standard C `malloc` ~~will not work.~~*works but buns.*
Therefore the default `std::vector` and such will ~~not work too~~*be buns too*.
You have to use the ESP memory APIs to manage your own memory.
*Programs are all about manipulating memory.*

### Communication
Using the GPIO pins, for the ESP32 board to connect to the other components, such as screen and keyboards.
It consist of 3 parts:
- Panel - The handle or software manager class of the actual component (class representation of the actual part)
- IO - The point-to-point connection of a GPIO pin to the according pin of the actual hardware part.
- Bus - The manager of IOs, that defines a specific protocol, and toggle signals in that protocol according to the data you provided it.
Each part usually have a handle. it's the handle of the struct that stores the informations. and a config struct, which will be applied to a handle by a specific API.

# 2026-04-17

## 2026-04-17 17:45:22:<br>Category: Hardware Programming<br>Topic: GPIO Control
```cpp
#include "driver/gpio.h"
```

There are 2 sets of initialization for GPIO control:
- Direct Immediate functions
- Init-time baked configuration

### The system and the attributes
Just like many other big system *(im referencing OpnGL here)*, ESP-IDF's GPIO control system is controled by handles and attributes.
Each pin has it's own pin number. Sometimes it's bitmask, sometimes it's an index number. *The pin number is representing the IO number on the chip.*
And each pin have it's own configurations, which could be set using functions or a config class.
The available attributes are:
- mode: the IO mode: either input, output, or both way
  	```
  	GPIO_MODE_INPUT        // input
	GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT       // output
	GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT_OD    // open-drain
	GPIO_MODE_INPUT_OUTPUT // both way
	```
- enabling pull up / enabling pull down
- type of interruption *(see interrupt section below)*
	```
	GPIO_INTR_DISABLE    // disable
	GPIO_INTR_POSEDGE    // when become 1
	GPIO_INTR_NEGEDGE    // when become 0
	GPIO_INTR_ANYEDGE    // when state change
	GPIO_INTR_LOW_LEVEL  // when is 0 (repeative)
	GPIO_INTR_HIGH_LEVEL // when is 1 (repeative)
	```

#### Id system
IDs in GPIO controls are just integers. Defined by `GPIO_NUM_n` enum.
When involving multiple ids, it becomes bit mask:
`0b0001` <- this is GPIO 1.
`0b1000` <- this is GPIO 4.
*Usually you can do: `1uLL << n`.*

### Direct Immediate functions

#### configuration

`gpio_set_direction(id, value)`

Set the direction *(mode)* of the indicated pin.

`gpio_set_pull_mode(id, value)`

Set the pull mode for the indicated pin.
Option available:
```
GPIO_PULLUP_ONLY
GPIO_PULLDOWN_ONLY
GPIO_PULLUP_PULLDOWN
GPIO_FLOATING
```

#### direct access

`gpio_get_level(id)`

Get the indicated pin's current state.
Return 1 or 0.

`gpio_set_level(id, level)`

Set the indicated pin's current state.
`level`: 0 or 1

### Init-time baked configuration
*You set the config once, and it runs forever.*
```c
struct gpio_config_t {
    uint64_t pin_bit_mask; // bit masked pin numbers
    gpio_mode_t mode; // mode
    gpio_pullup_t pull_up_en; // boolean
    gpio_pulldown_t pull_down_en; // boolean
    gpio_int_type_t intr_type; // interrupt type (see interrupt section below)
};
```
You construct an object of this struct, configure it, and then pass it to `gpio_config()`, and then it's stored in the hardware register forever, and the GPIO pins you specified will run according to these rules.
*Look at these enums and functions and structs, back to WindowsAPI i guess... —— TX_Jerry*

`gpio_config(&config)`

Take in a pointer of a `gpio_config_t` object and set the configuration of the selected GPIO pins (defined in the struct).

#### Attributes

`pin_bit_mask`

The pins that you intend to apply this config to.
This value is bitmasked pin numbers (`1uLL << n`) combined together with bit or.
For example:
```cpp
pin_bit_mask = (1uLL << 1) | (1uLL << 2); // pin 1 and 2
```
or
```cpp
pin_bit_mask = 0b11 << 1; // pin 1 and 2
```

`mode`

The io mode of the pin.
Available options:
```cpp
GPIO_MODE_INPUT        // input
GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT       // output
GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT_OD    // open-drain
GPIO_MODE_INPUT_OUTPUT // both way
```

`pull_up_en` / `pull_down_en`

*It's just booleans. Ignore the enums, they are just int values.*
Enable or disable the pull up / pull down.

`intr_type`

*see interrupt section below.*

### Interrupt - The callback system

The interrupt feature is basically the callback system / event driven system of ESP-IDF.
*Similar to GLFW and Qt,* You can register a function pointer to be called when a selected state change happens.
So in summary (of the one sentence above), you have 2 things to configure: **what** function to call, and **when**

#### APIs

`gpio_install_isr_service(0)`

*Just call this at the init-time before using interrupt stuff.*
Initialization of interrupt and the entire callback system.

*In `gpio_config_t`:*
`intr_type`

Set the **When** attribute of the callback function for the pin selected.
Available attributes:
```cpp
GPIO_INTR_DISABLE    // disable
GPIO_INTR_POSEDGE    // when become 1
GPIO_INTR_NEGEDGE    // when become 0
GPIO_INTR_ANYEDGE    // when state change
GPIO_INTR_LOW_LEVEL  // when is 0 (repeative)
GPIO_INTR_HIGH_LEVEL // when is 1 (repeative)
```

`gpio_set_intr_type(id, value)` (Immediate)

Set the `intr_type` of a specific pin.

`gpio_isr_handler_add(id, funcPtr, nullptr)`

Register a callback function to a pin id.
`id`: the targeting pin id. just integer

#### **Important Note**

The function for call back often need to have `IRAM_ATTR` attribute:
```cpp
void IRAM_ATTR callback() { ... }
```
It makes ESP32 puts it in Instruction RAM instead of flash, avoiding crashes when flash memory is not available.

---
And also, notice that the callback system is not a software driven, but a hardware driven thing.
The callback function is running in restricted condition, so **don't put somthing like `malloc`.**

### Other APIs

`gpio_reset_pin(id)`

Reset the selected pin.

## 2026-04-17 19:57:06:<br>Category: Hardware Programming<br>Topic: Heap Management
```cpp
#include "esp_heap_caps.h"
```

*now we are talking! —— TX_Jerry*
Heap management in ESP32 have 2 major parts:
- Querying
- Allocating
***Notice that the standard `malloc` and `std::vector` still works, it's just not work that fine since you cannot set specifc attributes, and also: Fragmentation is a important thing now.***

### Caps

*Basically attributes of the buffer (yeah my brain is full of OpenGL concepts).*
Caps (Capability constraint) will tell the allocator the capabilities this memory mush have.
If there's no satisfied memory, it will just return `nullptr`.
Caps can be combined with bit or.
Available Options:
```cpp
MALLOC_CAP_8BIT      // normal data access
MALLOC_CAP_32BIT     // 32-bit aligned
MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL  // internal RAM (fast)
MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM    // external PSRAM
MALLOC_CAP_DMA       // usable by DMA
MALLOC_CAP_EXEC      // executable (IRAM)
```

### Querying

`heap_caps_get_free_size(caps)`

Get the current total free memory of certain constraints (caps).
`@return`: size_t

`heap_caps_get_largest_free_block(caps)`

Get the biggest continuous block of memory that satisfies the provided contraints.
`@return`: size_t

`heap_caps_check_integrity_all(print_errors)`

Check for memory corruptions and invalid writes.
`@return`: boolean -> good bit / bad bit

### Allocating

*Basically just standard C APIs but with `heap_caps_` prefix, and an additional parameter: `caps`.*
It supports most of the standard C allocation APIs:
```c
void* malloc(size_t size);
void free(void* ptr);
void* calloc(size_t n, size_t size);
void* realloc(void* ptr, size_t size);
```
but with prefix and caps:
```c
void* heap_caps_malloc(size_t size, uint32_t caps);
void heap_caps_free(void* ptr);
void* heap_caps_calloc(size_t n, size_t size, uint32_t caps);
void* heap_caps_realloc(void* ptr, size_t size, uint32_t caps);
```

### DMA

DMA(Direct Memory Access) allows Hardware Peripherals to directly fetch data from the RAM memory.
It makes a lot operations much faster, such as sending data to a bus, or use specific protocols.
But DMA would require:
- specifc region in RAM
- and continguous memory

# 2026-04-18

## 2026-04-18 13:02:10:<br>Category: Hardware Programming<br>Topic: Logging System
```cpp
#include "esp_log.h"
```

*Notice that normal `printf` and `cout` still works, but using the native ESP_LOG is just better practice for structure and stablity.*
The syntax of `ESP_LOG*` functions are fairly similar to the standard C `printf`, but they have a parameter before everything:
```cpp
ESP_LOGI("Main", ...); // there's one more parameter before the regular `printf` parameters
```
The new parameter is the "Tag" of this log message. It would be printed with the message in some default format.
The usual practice is define a `constexpr const char* tag` string and use that through out the process.

---
You probably noticed that I used `ESP_LOGx`. That means there are multiple function with the same parameter set and the `ESP_LOG` prefix.
**Each of these function is correspnding to a log level.**
There are 5 of these functions:
| Level         | Use                   |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| `E` - Error   | something broke       |
| `W` - Warning | something suspicious  |
| `I` - Info    | normal important info |
| `D` - Debug   | debugging details     |
| `V` - Verbose | spam-level detail     |

## 2026-04-19 00:20:43:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: The heap layout and Statistics experiment
*What i used to be told is that ESP32's heap is really fragmented, and very small. The usable space have only 140kb.*

Here's the test code:
```cpp
#include "esp_log.h"
#include "esp_heap_caps.h"


extern "C" void app_main(void) {
	size_t heapCapacity = heap_caps_get_free_size(MALLOC_CAP_8BIT),
	       internalCapacity = heap_caps_get_free_size(MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL),
	       dmaCapacity = heap_caps_get_free_size(MALLOC_CAP_DMA),
	       heapChunk = heap_caps_get_largest_free_block(MALLOC_CAP_8BIT),
	       internalChunk = heap_caps_get_largest_free_block(MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL),
	       dmaChunk = heap_caps_get_largest_free_block(MALLOC_CAP_DMA);

	ESP_LOGI("Jerry", "Current Heap Capacity: %u", heapCapacity);
	ESP_LOGI("Jerry", "Current Internal Capacity: %u", internalCapacity);
	ESP_LOGI("Jerry", "Current DMA Capacity: %u", dmaCapacity);
	ESP_LOGI("Jerry", "Current Heap Chunk: %u", heapChunk);
	ESP_LOGI("Jerry", "Current Internal Chunk: %u", internalChunk);
	ESP_LOGI("Jerry", "Current DMA Chunk: %u", dmaChunk);
}
```
And here's the log:
```
I (260) main_task: Calling app_main()
I (260) Jerry: Current Heap Capacity: 401356
I (260) Jerry: Current Internal Capacity: 401356
I (260) Jerry: Current DMA Capacity: 393568
I (270) Jerry: Current Heap Chunk: 335872
I (270) Jerry: Current Internal Chunk: 335872
I (280) Jerry: Current DMA Chunk: 335872
I (280) main_task: Returned from app_main()
```
You can clearly see that indeed the biggest contiugous chunk is not same size as the total heap capacity, which indeed means that the heap is fragmented at stratup.
But, The one contiguous chunk is big enough, and way bigger then my old hypothesis. 356kb is a decent number of memory, in the context of embeded system.
Of course, this test is performed in the condition where things like wifi and LCD are not setted up, which means this is the pure and maximum memory it can possibly get.

## 2026-04-19 00:26:44:<br>Category: Personal Journal<br>Topic: The Lapse crash
Today, I had recorded 5 hours during afternoon, but when I tried to stop the recording, via pressing the stop button obviously, it didn't work: it purely refused to react, and nothing responded.
So I tried close and then reopen the browser after pressing the stop button a few times, and then I end up in the resume menu.
And then I clicked `submit`, and after that the progress bar came out, and it stoped at the `encryping session #1` stage, then a log poped out saying failure, something have to be smaller then 2GB.
And I also tried resume and then stop again using the stop button, but it appears the same error.
My hypothesis is that my lapse video is too big, since it's the longest one ive ever done: 5 hr. But I know other people that was doing more then 24 hours of lapsing, but still got away with it.
So... im confused and sad right now, because I lost 5 hour of recording....

# 2026-04-19

## 2026-04-19 12:33:04:<br>Category: Hardware Programming<br>Topic: The Graphics API - `ESP_LCD`
*`ESP_LCD` is a great example of the "Communication" component of the entire ESP32 general pipeline.*

`ESP_LCD` is a framework for hardware display, **It's not a render engine.** It only:
- Talk to the LCD driver
- Send framebuffer (raw pixel data, that is **composed by you**)
- manage bus communication
Anything higher then raw pixel data will **not** be managed by `ESP_LCD`.
*It's the next lower level then OpenGL.*
*The job `ESP_LCD` is doing is put the raw framebuffer to the screen, so the starting point of `ESP_LCD` API calls should be after framebuffer is constructed.*

### The 3 layer pipeline
There are 3 layers in the entire pipeline, each on top of each other.
- **Bus**
	The lowest layer, representing the actual lines of connections.
	It stores the metadata of pins, manages data transportation - basically just toggling the pins' on/off.
	It manages protocol of communication between `ESP32` and the LCD screen, essentially *the pattern to toggle the pins.*
- **IO**
	The intermetiate layer, representing the formatting of the data transferring.
- **Panel**
	The highest layer, representing the actual driver of the LCD screen.
	It's where you call all the top level API like draw call function and init funciton.

### The API pipeline
Each layer is a struct. It's inited with a function, where it *follows a standard C pattern, and* have you pass in the pointer to the object of that struct for the layer. In this case, the pointer parameter appears at the end of the function.
Each layer would require the previous layer as a parameter to init. *(except the lowest layer)*
After the Panel is inited, the layer below it is almost never touched again. All the operations will be done via the panel object.

### The Bus & IO Init and Terminate pipeline
**Init**
```cpp
esp_lcd_i80_bus_handle_t bus = nullptr;
esp_lcd_i80_bus_config_t config_bus = {};
esp_lcd_new_i80_bus(&config_bus, &bus);

esp_lcd_panel_io_handle_t io = nullptr;
esp_lcd_panel_io_i80_config_t config_io = {};
esp_lcd_new_panel_io_i80(bus, &config_io, &io);
```

**Terminate**
```cpp
esp_lcd_panel_io_del(io);
io = nullptr;
esp_lcd_del_i80_bus(bus);
bus = nullptr;
```
*well well well, look at the 2 delete functions, back to the inconsistent API hell... fortunately we don't have distinction between bind API and DSA API in ESP-IDF like what OpenGL has...*

#### The config_t parameters
**esp_lcd_i80_bus_config_t**
```cpp
struct esp_lcd_i80_bus_config_t {
    int dc_gpio_num;           // data/command pin
    int wr_gpio_num;           // write clock pin
    int clk_src;               // clock source (just write `LCD_CLK_SRC_DEFAULT`)

    int data_gpio_nums[16];    // parallel data pins (D0-D7 or D0-D15)
    int bus_width;             // `8` for 8-bit or `16` for 16-bit (Attension, it's the bus width, which is the data pin count, not the RGB protocol)

    size_t max_transfer_bytes; // DMA buffer limit (Unit: byte)
};
```

**esp_lcd_panel_io_i80_config_t**
```cpp
struct esp_lcd_panel_io_i80_config_t {
    int cs_gpio_num;                  // chip select (CS pin number)
    int pclk_hz;                      // pixel clock speed (usually 10 ~ 20)

    int trans_queue_depth;            // DMA queue size (usually 10 Mhz, which is `10 * 1000 * 1000`)

    int lcd_cmd_bits;                 // usually 8
    int lcd_param_bits;               // usually 8

    void (*on_color_trans_done)(...); // callback when finished
    void *user_ctx;                   // don't care about this
};
```

### The IO operations

`esp_lcd_panel_io_tx_param(io, command, parameter, parameterCount)`

Send a command and it's corrisponding parameters to the LCD screen.
*This function is the lower level function that `esp_lcd_panel_*` is using.*
It directly talk to the LCD screen, while using the protocol that the IO object is managing, so that you don't need to worry about it.
**Parameters**
`io`: The IO object
`command`: The command that's targeted to execute. type: `int`, it's defined by the driver type of the LCD that you are using. *(More of it in the future)*
`parameter`: The parameters about the command, type: `void*`. also defined by the driver type.
`parameterCount`: literally, parameter count.

`esp_lcd_panel_io_tx_color(io, command, data, dataLength)`
*The parameter signature of this function is exactly the same as `esp_lcd_panel_io_tx_param`, but they serve for different purposes.*
As if `esp_lcd_panel_io_tx_param` serves for command, this function serves for data transfer.
Specificly, **sending the raw pixel data.**
In this function, the `command` parameter is usually `0x2C`, which stands for **memory write**.

### The Panel
Because ESP_LCD don't support ILI9488 driver which is what i am using, so I decided to write my own driver...

## 2026-04-19 13:58:58:<br>Category: Design Report<br>Topic: The Screen Grid
The screen will have a width of 480px and height of 320px.
Since the project only need to display text, acting as a terminal, the entire screen can be dedicated for text rendering, and nothing else need to considered.
And since text are just retangles, abstract the entire screen into a grid system will be a good idea.

The entire screen is mapped into a `24x8` grid system, which each grid has size of `20x40px`.
Each grid is one ASCII character. It would have 4 pixels subtracted from width as horizontal margin (each side 2px), and 8 pixels from height for vertical margin (each side 4px), remaining a `16x32px` space for the actual text.
The height of one character will be split into 3 parts: top (9px), center (14px), bottom (9px).

*Or maybe move the bottom margin to the top? and maybe change the parts to: top(8px), center(16px), bottom(8px)*

## 2026-04-20 21:51:39:<br>Category: Hardware Programming<br>Topic: Making our own graphics driver - ILI9488 Documentation
### The begin of the problem
**The stupid ESP_LCD does not support ILI9488.**

### The Documentation - what save your life *(don't trust AI, always question)*
*If you want to build a project with screen size 480x320 and Parallel 8080, most likely you will use ILI9488, and most likely you will require to write your own driver.*
*And when it comes to hardware, you don't want to mess up, so the only reliable source of knowledge.*
*(well actually testing results is also a thing...)*

**Datasheet**
https://www.hpinfotech.ro/ILI9488.pdf
*You can literally find ILI9488 Data Sheet every where, this is just the one I am using.*

**How to read it**
*This is the main part.*

You will see a whole bunch of weird things, and you probably don't understand it. *(I don't either.)*
Well the best first step is turn to page 140, or search `5. Command`.
This will lead you directly to the command table, which is the most useful part *(I think)* of the entire datasheet.
You can find the usage and parameter descriptions here. More detailed information can be found after the table *(it's very long)*, in their respective sequence.

**How to read the command parameter description**

You see there are multiple rows, *(some of them may only have one, it's actually most of them have one)*, each row is a parameter, except the top row, which is the command data itself.
*If a command only have one row, then it means it don't have any parameters.*
The D1~D7 are the actual bit data of each pin. mostly you ignore that, but just read the hex value at the very right.

*Because each parameter might be bigger then a byte, for example, an `u16`, which is 2 bytes. then you need to do a bit to bit trick to put them into individual bits.*

# 2026-04-21

## 2026-04-21 19:41:53:<br>Category: Hardware Programming<br>Topic: Timer system
*There are multiple ways to either calculate duration or delay tasks. There's no perfect solution, each method serve for it's specifc purpose of usage. By the way, std::chrono might not work, or internally use them.*

### `vTaskDelay`
*Probably the simplest and most common used delay API in all methods.*
Function from FreeRTOS, operated and managed by the system.
The core logic of it is tell the schedualer that this thread / task is not running for a period of time.
It's not the most precise one - in fact, because it relies on FreeRTOS's tick system, it's pretty *inaccurate*, **in the microsecond world.**
It could be used for normal ms level delay, such as wait for a hardware to warm up, or force a sequence of execution.

```cpp
vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(500)); // 500 ms
```

`pdMS_TO_TICK(n)`

Convert ms to FreeRTOS's tick.

## 2026-04-21 23:17:25:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: The Begin of TXCompute
This is almost the first actual progress of my project, **so far.**
In the pass time, I was all just learning. But today, once the first piece of code had reached from my brain to VSCode, I know, the development of TXCompute, had finally started.
April 8th, is when I started learning hardware. It took me 2 weeks to understand the hardware reality. And then, I have one month, to build something amazing.
And I, am prepared for that.

## 2026-04-21 23:21:55:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: The ILI9488 Driver
*It's basically just a wrapper of the io system.*
Since ESP_LCD don't have a driver support for ILI9488, I have to write my own driver.
My driver is very tiny. It only compose of 2 component / functions:
- Initialization of the LCD screen;
- Write data to specific location of the LCD screen's framebuffer.
That's it. And that's all I need.
Call `ILI9488DriverPanel::init()` to initialize; Call `ILI9488DriverPanel::draw()` to write pixels.
*Yeah it's this simple.*

### Note
I potensially need to add gamma in initialization in the future too.

### The next step
Currently the `ILI9488DriverPanel` is just a static function collection. Stand alone it cannot do the job of rendering, it needs the IO.
Therefore, the next step will be a wrapper of the `ILI9488DriverPanel` driver and the IO, which will include the initialization, uninitialization, and forwarding of the IO and bus - so this will be a actual class object now.
And the goal of this wrapper will be **"Be able to draw content with just providing position, dimension, and data."**
I even have a name for it already:
**`FrameComposer`**

## 2026-04-22 23:28:23:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: TXCSL - `ExpressionEvaluator`
Since the Project of TXCompute had started, as the core logic handler of the project, TXCSL engine started becoming one of the considerations.
A math "programming language", definitely have to have a expression parser, and that's the first component I thought about the TXCSL engine.

---
`ExpressionEvaluator` is a string parser that handle 2 things:
- parse raw string expression into numbers and operations
- evaluate the expression according to the BEDMAS (order of evaluation) rule

### Key idea
`ExpressionEvaluator` will have  stages to evaluate a expression string:
1. structure the order of operation tree
   - compose brackets ranges - each bracket is an individual expression (recursive parsing logic), treated as one variable at their parent level
     - depth stack
     - parent / child data structure
   - compose Major operation unit tree - separate the expression by Minor operations (`plus` or `subtract`)
2. evaluate
   - evaluate each Major unit
   - evaluate minor operation recursively

## 2026-04-22 23:55:09:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: `FrameComposer`
The wrapper around the `ILI9488Driver`, that manages the bus and io by RAII, so that the user only need to call `draw()` to render.

### Note
The `FrameComposer` deleted copy and move, it suppose to be only accessed by the singleton provided.

# 2026-04-23

## 2026-04-23 16:35:34:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: `TextRenderer`
The application interface of the entire render pipeline.
Provide function: `draw(position, character)` to render the text bitmap.
The user still require to provide the bitmap data of the text / characters.

### Note
**The format of the `bitemapData` for text:**
Each character is required to have the same dimension.
Each character will occupy `std::ceil(width * height / 8)` bytes. Each bit (total of 8) in one byte will corrispond to one pixel (1 bpp / 1 Bit Per Pixel). If the pixel count is not exactly multiple of 8, the remaining of the last byte will be ignored.

## 2026-04-23 23:20:34:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: TXCSL - `ExpressionEvaluator`: updated stucture
Instead of letting the user provide raw std::byte buffer, we ask user to provide a struct to me modified by the evaluator that contains all the necessary values to be evaluated:
```cpp
struct Expression {
	std::span<Command> commandQueue;
	std::span<num> constantBuffer;
	std::span<num> variableBuffer;
	tx::u32 registerCount;
};
```
And the stage from raw expression string to this expression data struct is called "compile". *(used to be called compose)*
After "compilation", the user will then pass the "compiled" result `Expression` struct object to `evaluate()` function, which will calculate the value of the expression.

### The reason of "compile"
Because I want to support function defining in the future, and since the "compilation" did most of the parsing job, is what's slow in the entire pipeline, "compiling" it into commands (aka instructions) is the method I think of to optimize it.

## 2026-04-24 13:23:47:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: Adding USB Host dependency
In ESP-IDF v6.0, USB host library component is moved from the core profile into managed_component category.
Therefore it cannot directly be added to the project by simply adding a name in CMakeLists.txt -> `idf_component_register` -> `REQUIRES`.
Instead, the library content need to be **registered**, then **downloaded** in the process of configuration.

### Adding Managed Component
#### 1. Register
You can register a managed component by using the `idf.py add-dependency` command in the ESP-IDF terminal.

`idf.py add-dependency` will write some information into a file (`<project>/main/idf_component.yml`), as metadata, they will be read during configure, and then trigger the download.
This step will **not** download anything.

For adding the USB host, there are 2 compoennts to be registered:
```bash
idf.py add-dependency "espressif/usb_host_hid^1.2.0"
idf.py add-dependency "espressif/usb^1.4.0"
```

##### Open an ESP-IDF terminal
*An ESP-IDF terminal is just a normal terminal with ESP-IDF environment.*
1. Open a normal terminal
2. `cd ~/.espressif/v6.0/esp-idf`
3. `./install.fish` *(or `install.sh` / `install.bat`)*
4. `. ./export.fish`
The current terminal is an ESP-IDF terminal now.

#### 2. Configure
```bash
idf.py reconfigure
```
This command will trigger the download of the new component added.
They will be stored at `<project>/managed_component`, with prefix: `espressif__`.
After this you can just add these component in the CMakeLists.txt:
```c
idf_component_register(
	REQUIRES
		"espressif__usb"
		"espressif__usb_host_hid"
)
```

### The `CMakePresets.json` Pitfall
If `<project>/${sourceDir}` exist, then you are in the `CMakePresets.json` pitfall.
```json
{
  "name": "config_debug",
  "displayName": "config_debug",
  "generator": "Ninja",
  "binaryDir": "${sourceDir}/build",
  "cacheVariables": {
    "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE": "Debug"
  }
},
```
This is a normal CMake preset entry, but the `"binaryDir"` entry will have problem with `idf.py`.
Because the `${sourceDir}` is a defined variable for `CMakePresets.json`, CMake understand what it is, but `idf.py` at the wrapper of CMake and who **don't** forward everything, it will not resolve the `${sourceDir}` variable but instead treating it as an actual literal, and actually make a directory called `${sourceDir}` in your `<project>` directory.

#### The Fix
Just delete the `${sourceDir}/`, change the value of `binaryDir` into a relative path: `"build"` , and it will resolve fine.
**Fixed CMakePresets.json entry:**
```json
{
  "name": "config_debug",
  "displayName": "config_debug",
  "generator": "Ninja",
  "binaryDir": "build",
  "cacheVariables": {
    "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE": "Debug"
  }
},
```

## 2026-04-24 16:00:01:<br>Category: Hardware Programming<br>Topic: `xTaskCreate`

`xTaskCreate(functionPtr, name, stackDepth, parameter, priority, &taskHandle)`

*Function from FreeRTOS,* Create a async task that runs parallel with every other threads.
*Similar to `std::thread`, but internally it's not a new thread.*
`functionPtr`: the pointer to the function to be executed as this task. it's parameter have to be `(void*)`, and it must never return
`name`: `const char* const` type (string), the name of this task, just for debug
`stackDepth`: `int` type, the size of stack of this task, in "word" (4 byte), usually `4096`
`parameter`: `void*` type, the parameter to the function of this task, `nullptr` for no parameter
`priority`: `int`  type, the priority of this task, varying between `0` ~ `25`, the higher the more frequent updated. usually `5`
`taskHandle`: `TaskHandle_t*` type pointer, the handle for future operations.

## 2026-04-24 15:16:31:<br>Category: Hardware Programming<br>Topic: The USB Host Pipeline
ESP32 S3 have it's native USB host peripherals, making it very easily compatible with expernal USB devices.
However, there are still a lot concepts to go through, before you can call `getKey()` for a USB keyboard.

### General Description
There are 3 general ideas in the USB Host pipeline:
- The USB engine
- HID
- The Callback Architecture

---
The entire USB system is based on the Hardware Peripherals that powers it.
Therefore there is no way it could be an OOP architecture.
Yes, it's a global state machine. Everything talks in global.

The USB engine is the lowest component in the USB host pipeline. It basically handles in direct data input from the D+/D- pins.
*By the way, the D+/D- ports are hardcoded to be "The ports" for USB usage. It's directly wired to the USB peripherals, which directly connecting to the handler API in the USB engine.*

The HID is an layer that's on top of the USB engine.
It also talks directly to the peripheral like the USB engine, therefore no need to attach handle of USB engine when initing it.
It's the higher level abstraction of direct USB data, transfrom them into events.

Both the USB engine and the HID engine runs in parallel, by the FreeRTOS's task scheduler.
*Note: it's not necessaryly in different threads, instead it's the scheduler switching between tasks.*

### The USB Engine / USB Host
**You need to manage the loop of the USB engine by yourself.**

#### Initialization
*The init of USB stuff is called "install".*

`usb_host_install(&config)`

Initialize the USB peripheral with `config`.

`usb_host_config_t`

The config struct of USB peripheral.
*~~It's surprisingly simple, only with one member.~~ It has multiple members, but usually you only need to specify one. The other ones are for advanced usage.*
```cpp
usb_host_config_t config{};
config.intr_flags = ESP_INTR_FLAG_LEVEL1;
```

#### Main Loop
*It's just an infinite while loop.*

**Basic Implementation**
*You can basically copy this implementation, since there's not really anything to be specialized here.*
```cpp
void usb_host_task(void*)
{
    while (true) {
        uint32_t event_flags;
        usb_host_lib_handle_events(portMAX_DELAY, &event_flags);
    }
}
```
This function would be launched as a async task (similar to a parallel thread, but managed by FreeRTOS), by function `xTaskCreate`.

It's basically just a loop calling `usb_host_lib_handle_events` constantly, who act like a `poll event` or `run` function in every async system.

`usb_host_lib_handle_events(delay, &resultFlag)`

*The parameters are basically irrelevant.*
Poll event.
`delay`: Maximum time to wait for an event before returning. It would block the thread until the delay runs out, or received an event. use `portMAX_DELAY` for block when there's no USB input / block until there's an event.
`resultFlag`: The outputing result flags, `uint32_t` type. usually ignored.

### HID
HID (Human Interface Device / Human Input Device) is the high level wrapper / interface of the USB engine.
**INPORTANT! It only handles human input devices such as keyboard and mouse, it DO NOT handle things like removable disk, that belongs to a different API.**
*Because there are so many devices use USB, they each talk in their own protocol, developer need to write driver for every one of them, and that's every tedious. Therefore HID exists as a solution to that.*
HID is a unified / standarized protocol of USB inputs.
HID have 2 parts: **Descriptor** and **Report**.

#### Descriptor
Describes the format of the report in a uniform method.
This will send once when the USB device connects to the port.

#### Report
The actual data of the events. Follows the format described by the Descriptor.
Reports are sent continuously and constantly, reflecting current device state.

#### The Pipeline
***There are 2 stages of HID:***
- **init (driver)**
- **runtime (interface)**

Each stage have a config struct, and their dedicated callback function.
Each stage will be declared started by a call of their respective init function.
The 2 stages came in a sequence: `init` -> `runtime`.
*HID reacts on the USB events.*

---
**Important Note**
In the case of multi device, the `init` stage is for the entire HID engine, only need to be called once. But the `runtime` stage is for each device, meaning that each device will have their own stage, and their own callback for `runtime` stage, and all of that comes together with the `runtime` stage. The init funciton for `runtime` stage will be called multiple times too.
**Specific for callbacks**
The callback for `init` stage is called `driver` callback. There will only one global `driver` callback. This callback is responsible of starting the `runtime` stage for each device.
THe callback for `runtime` stage is called `interface` callback. Optimally, there will be one `interface` callback for each driver, performing their unique logic. Different `interface` callback will be assigned in `driver` callback to different devices.

#### Initialization
**Init Stage**
**This initialization will be executed once.**
*Similar to the USB engine, the init funciton for `init` stage is also called "install"*

`hid_host_install(&config)`

Initialize the HID engine.
It will start the HID `init` stage, as well as starting the main loop.

```cpp
hid_host_driver_config_t hid_init_config = {
    .create_background_task = true, // enable driver's own task / main loop
    .task_priority = 5, // priority of the driver's task
    .stack_size = 4096, // stack size of the driver's task

    .callback = hid_driver_cb, // **Important** The function pointer of the `driver` callback function
    .callback_arg = nullptr, // arguments / parameters to pass into the callback function
};
```

*Note about the main loop of HID:*
*Unlike the USB engine where you need to write your own loop, HID have the loop implemented for you.*
*After initialization it will automaticly start runing.*

**Runtime Stage**
**This initialization will be execute multiple times throughout the program life time. It will be execute once for EACH device.**
**When the `runtime initialization` is executed for one device, that device is now in `runtime` stage. If there are other devices that haven't, they will still be in the `init` stage.**
*The `runtime initialization` will happen in the `driver` callback.*

`hid_host_device_open(device, &config)`
`hid_host_device_start(device)`

**Open and prepare device** and **Start receiving reports**.
*`hid_host_device_open(...)` is the "offical" init function for `runtime` stage, it will start the `runtime` stage. But usually `hid_host_device_start(...)` will be called directly after it, since it enables the device's report flow. So these 2 functions combined is the initialization for the `runtime` stage.*

```cpp
hid_host_device_config_t hid_runtime_config = {
    .callback = hid_interface_cb, // **Important** The function pointer of the `interface` callback function
    .callback_arg = nullptr, // arguments to pass to the callback function
};
```

### Termination
*Nothing much to say, just call them in the callback when the event is `DISCONNECT`, or in the destructor... whatever you want.*
```cpp
hid_host_device_stop(device);
hid_host_device_close(device);

hid_host_uninstall();
```

### Callback
Callback is the core of the HID system.
According to the 2 stages, there are 2 callbacks:
- driver callback (correspond to the `init` stage)
- interface callback (correspond to the `runtime` stage)

#### **`Driver` callback**
*It act like the initializer for each device.*
Manage the action when *and only when* a new device is connected.

**Function Signature**
*This function is the function that you will implement by yourself and reference in the `hid_host_driver_config_t.callback` member.*

```cpp
void hid_host_driver_event_cb(
	hid_host_device_handle_t hid_device_handle,
    const hid_host_driver_event_t event,
    void* arg);
```

**`hid_host_driver_event_t`:**
```cpp
enum hid_host_driver_event_t {
    HID_HOST_DRIVER_EVENT_CONNECTED = 0x00
};
```

#### **`Interface` callback**
Everytime an event happens during the `runtime` stage, the HID engine will call the `interface` callback function with the info of the event.

*Notice that the `interface` callback also manages the uninit of the device. And `driver` callback only manages initialization.*

**Function Signature**
*This function is the function that you will implement by yourself and reference in the `hid_host_device_config_t.callback` member.*

```cpp
void hid_host_interface_event_cb(
	hid_host_device_handle_t hid_device_handle,
    const hid_host_interface_event_t event,
    void* arg);
```

**`hid_host_interface_event_t`:**
```cpp
enum hid_host_interface_event_t {
    HID_HOST_INTERFACE_EVENT_INPUT_REPORT = 0x00,
    HID_HOST_INTERFACE_EVENT_TRANSFER_ERROR,
    HID_HOST_INTERFACE_EVENT_DISCONNECTED,
    HID_HOST_INTERFACE_EVENT_SUSPENDED,
    HID_HOST_INTERFACE_EVENT_RESUMED,
};
```

### Callback Functions
*These function should be called in the event callback funciton.*
*`device`: the device handle of the targeting device. It's the first parameter of the callback function.*

`hid_host_device_get_raw_input_report_data(device, &data, capacity, &length)`

Get the event data (report data) of a device. *Get most recent event data.*
`data`: `uint8_t*` type
`capacity`: `size_t*` type, the size of the `data` buffer
`length`: `size_t*` type, the actual length of the written data to the `data` buffer

### Final pipeline

## 2026-04-24 22:28:15:<br>Category: Personal Journal<br>Topic: The ChatGPT pitfall
Today I learned the USB host pipeline via ChatGPT.
And when i tried to implement the framework, I found out that a lot of APIs ChatGPT gave me is missing.
By diving into the source code, i found out that the pipeline ChatGPT gave me is the older version of it, and it completely don't match with the current version.
Then i have to read the source code and rewrite my report.
So the conclusion is: for library like ESP-IDF, that updates constantly, reading the source code is way more reliable, also surprisingly faster then talking with AI.

## 2026-04-26 22:54:05:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: `USBFramework`
`USBFramework` is almost just a wrapper to simplify the pipeline of USB Host.
It manages the process of initialization and uninitialization, but left the callbacks to the user's decision.
It's a static class, meaning that there will be no object created for it.

### APIs
`USBFramework` provide 5 functions, 2 for `init` stage (driver) and 3 for `runtime` stage (interface).
There are 2 function: init and uninit for each stage:

```cpp
USBFramework::driverInit(callbck);
USBFramework::driverUninit();
USBFramework::interfaceInit(device, callback);
USBFramework::interfaceUninit(device);
```

and one extra helper function to get report data, which is just a direct forwarding wrapper function:

```cpp
USBFramework::interfaceGetReport(device, &data, dataLengthMax, &dataLength);
```

## 2026-04-27 23:08:27:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: `USBKeyboardInputHandler`
*This is way more complicated then I thought.*
`USBKeyboardInputHandler` is a wrapper with logic of `USBFramework`. It contains specialized logic for **keyboard IO** analyzing, as well as the corrisponding driver related setup.
`USBKeyboardInputHandler` can be separated as 2 parts:
- Driver Oriented Setup
- Logic Oriented Handler
`USBKeyboardInputHandler` is also a global state machine, who also adopted the design of *"pure static class"* just like `USBFramework`.

### Driver
Contains the implementation of `driverCallback_impl` and `interfaceCallback_impl`, as the lifetime manager of the process.
Also contain the essential enum types such as `Key`, `Action` and `Mod`, as well as `keyCodeTable`, which is the lookup table describing the translation between HID code and a uniformed code set that's corresponding to ASCII.
*The `Key` enum design is referenced from GLFW 3. Credit: `https://www.glfw.org`*
*Bro it took me sooooo long to write all of that by hand. I have to look at the HID Datasheet and copy the value down by hand one by one! —— TX_Jerry*

### Logic
Handles:
- The decode process of the Modifiers
- The Action state
  - Release
  - Repeat
  - Press
- Current pressing key
  - Key cache
The core entry function is `handleReport_impl()`, which is being called by the `interfaceCallback` when an keyboard input event happens.

### Interface
The user is only exposed to 3 functions:
- `init()`
	Initialize the entire system, including the `USBFramework`. *(it's actually just initing `USBFramework` but.. it's just for encapsulation)*
- `uninit()`
	Uninitialize the entire system, including the `USBFramework`.
- `setCallback(InputCallbackFunc_t func)`
	Set the event callback when a keyboard input event happens.

**`InputCallbackFunc_t`**:
```cpp
using USBKeyboardInputHandler::InputCallbackFunc_t = void (*)(
	USBKeyboardInputHandler::Key,
	USBKeyboardInputHandler::Action,
	USBKeyboardInputHandler::Mod); // key, action, mod
```

## 2026-04-27 23:32:12:<br>Category: Personal Journal<br>Topic: The development of `USBKeyboardInputHandler`
*This is way more complicated then I thought.*

### First struggle - Knowledge mismatch
This one is already mentioned in previous journal. It's the ChatGPT's outdated explaination, that causes me to rewrite everything in the middle of implementation.

### Second Struggle - Unavoidable hardwork
The HID keyboard key code does not match with ASCII. And It's essential for me to have ASCII because well, I making a terminal.
So I have to write a giant static array to map each HID key code to the uniform key set that matches ASCII.
Fortunatly, in this part I have GLFW (`https://www.glfw.org`) to reference.

### Third Struggle - `bit_trick` Side Quest
HID keyboard report uses bitmask to pass the modifiers.
Because I had not really that much experience with bit masks, I decided to learn some basic operations.
After learning, I decided to expand my own library: TXLib with the bit operation helpers, since it's necessary for the current project, as well as important for future usage.
And that side quest took me pretty far, but eventually it paid off, the modifier part of the keyboard report are now solved in just 4 lines of code.

### Forth Struggle - State Machine error
During finalizing the `USBKeyboardInputHandler`, I found a bug in my code.
This is a bug that I consider a major bug, because, well, it took me a long time to find:

In the old `handlerRepeat_impl()`:
```cpp
static void handleRepeat_impl(tx::u32 keyIndex) {
	KeyCacheEntry_impl& key = keyCache[keyIndex];
	if (key.repeatBeginCounter >= RepeatBeginCounterMax) { // already at repeating stage
		key.repeatBeginCounter = 0; // <---------------- look over here
		if (key.repeatCounter >= RepeatCounterMax) { // counter terminates; call click event
			key.repeatCounter = 0;
			callCallback_impl(key.key, Action::Repeat);
		} else
			key.repeatCounter++;
	} else
		key.repeatBeginCounter++;
}
```
i reset the `key.repeatBeginCounter` every time. but what that does is that it restarts the begin counter again, and the actual repeat stage will never be reached. so after i removed the key.repeatBeginCounter = 0; everything works perfectly now.

## 2026-04-29 23:05:40:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: `ExpressionEvaluator`: `Tokenlizer`
The tokenlizer in `ExpressionEvaluator` is the core of the compilation.
It contains lexering, tokenlization, and parsing in one stage, since the they are almost together.
***This is a design decision, instead of a mistake. The trade off of using a standard Parsing Pipeline is that it would allocate more memory for metadata, as well as more complex control flow, which will take more time to organize and design. Not saying mine is faster... well it's definitely slower, but at least it's simpler to write.***
*Listening to my pale exposition... i know you know im just trying to make me look not that dumb...*
It still followed the *temporary object* and *internal state machine* design pattern as before.
The next step will be the actual `Compiler`, and then the `compilation` stage will be finished.
After that, `evaluation` stage will be fairly easy.
Hopefully I can finish `compilation` tomorrow, and the entire thing by friday.
And I'll start actually working on some CAD and hardware stuff....

	return 1;
}
// without consideration of brackets
void parseTokenPlain_impl() {
	// it's either a variable or a number or an operation
	char c = m_source[m_index];
	if (isOperation_impl(c)) {
		parseOperation_impl();
	} else if (isVariableName_impl(c)) {
		parseVariable_impl();
	} else { // it's a number or syntax error
		parseNumber_impl();
	}
}
```
This is the logic I initially designed for the parsing logic of `ExpressionEvaluator`.
All the purpose of the "section" design is to avoid the out of bound of `m_brackets`'s last access, when there's no more up coming brackets.
But all of that can be solved by just add an `if` bound check.
Separating it into 2 sections, that each have their own consideration can indeed minimize the cost of the `if` boundary check, but that's considered as a minor optimization. And the trade off to do it is major.
First, the manuel separation and distinction of 2 modes are very rendundent, both in size of code, size of binary and performance.
Second, preserving this kind of virtual structure requires the reader of the code to build mental models, often needs comments to explain, lowering readability.
At last, because the "section" layout is not a artificial structure, instead it exist natually when there is brackets exist. Therefore in the 2 mode the `if` will result exactly the same through out:
```
[true (not out of bound / there are more brackets)][false (out of bound / there's no more brackets)]
```
And in modern CPUs, branch prediction exists. For this kind of contiguous results, the CPU branch predictor and produce nearly **zero cost** branching.

---
**Therefore, give up on minor optimizations!**

## 2026-05-01 15:48:38:<br>Category: Thinking Log<br>Topic: TXCSL: `ExpressionEvaluator`: Compilation
i need to tell the state machine that just returned from the expended expression what to do
what will it return?
it will return a value... no, a **register id**
that id is the result of that expression
*The id of registers can be managed by the `HandleSystem` i made before.*
and i will use that id, as.. what?
wait, let's go over again:
when encountered an expression, i need to save the state, so that i can continue after
the current section... section is defined by the `+` or `-` operations. basically a section is a bunch of `*` and `/`.
when compiling the current section, the first thing i need to do is declare a register, as the result of the section
then go over each entry of the section ().
- if it's a constant or variable, then push an instruction of `dest = result, a = result, b = i`
- if it's an expression (let's call it `child`), interrupt the current state, expand the `child` expression, **save the index** of the `child` expression in `parent` expression
and after `child expression returns`, i would have a register that contains the value of it.
then proceed on the loop, or foreach process on `parent` expression

---
whoever expands an expression need to tell what register that expression to put result in.

 * The expanding logic:
 * When a new expression is found in the parent expression, the compilation of the parent expression will be interrupted.
 * When expanding in the process of compile, it have to make sure that all the context is prepared for the next `compileExpression_impl` call
 * Additional, it need to save it's own internal state, so that when the expanded expression is done compiling,
 * it can continue with the value of the expanded expression.
 * 
 * Detail:
 * When encountered a expression:
 * 1. pop the already processed tokens, including the expression one. but save the operation token before the expression token
 * 2. push 3 new token: [expressionRegister][operation][majorExpressionRegister]

## 2026-05-02 23:37:04:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: TXCSL: `ExpressionEvaluator` compilation test
There were 3 bugs found today, 2 are fixed, the remaining one requires refactor:

### Missing stack index update
After the erasement of the operator token, I forgot to update the `tokenIndex` in the stack, which causes all the future access being off by one.
Fix: add stack update

### Extra `RegisterFree` call
After detected the majorOperation had requested return, the compileExpresison_impl will free the `majorExprReg`.
But it's not supposed to be freed, because it's still storing the already processed values in the major expression, and the register id is currently in the token buffer, and will be freed when the next iteration gets to it.
According to:
```cpp
/**
 * The lifetime of the major expression register(in the compileExpression_impl -> majorExprReg):
 * It will be created if the expression is have more then one major expression
 * It would become the result register of the following major expressions
 * The value of it will be cleared and overwritten over and over, but it will not be freed, until the current expression is done compiling.
 * In the case of expanding new expression, it would be written into token cache, then freed by the next iteration, who consumes the value in the register
 */
```
Fix: remove the extra free

### Losted processed value after major expression requested return in `compileExpression_impl`
In `compileMajorExpression_impl`, when a return (an expansion of new expression) is required, it appends the token buffer to store the current result register, which contains the value of all the processed value. This is how it makes sure it does not lose them.
But in `compileExpression_impl` (the parent function of `compileMajorExpression_impl`), there's no such logic implemented. and this inconsistency resulted that the processed value will be lost.
Fix: add similar logic
*(refactor required, not fixed yet)*

# 2026-05-03

## 2026-05-03 23:41:30:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: Complete TXCSL: Compiler and Evaluator
*The original `ExpressionEvaluator` is split into `Compiler` and `Evaluator`.*

The TXCSL core engine: expression evaluator is being organized into the `tx::csl` namespace, and separated into 2 parts:
- The Compiler
- The Evaluator

### Additional Documentation
```cpp
 /**
 * Note: the compilation of each expression should not manage their result register. instead, the parent scope of that expression will have the ownership of that register, and the responsibility of freeing it
 * 
 * The lifetime of the major expression register(in the compileExpression_impl -> majorExprReg):
 * It will be created if the expression is have more then one major expression
 * It would become the result register of the following major expressions
 * The value of it will be cleared and overwritten over and over, but it will not be freed, until the current expression is done compiling.
 * In the case of expanding new expression, it would be written into token cache, then freed by the next iteration, who consumes the value in thregister
 * 
 * The expanding logic for `compileExpression_impl`
 * *The above expanding logic is for `compileMajorExpression_impl`.*
 * Similar to `compileMajorExpression_impl`, `compileExpression_impl` also need to save the state:
 * - the register that stores the result of the previous processed values (the old resultReg)
 * - the operator between the old resultReg and the major expression with expansion in it
 * But different from majorExpression, it does not need to delete tokens,
 * because that's already done in `compileMajorExpression_impl`, since they share the same token buffer.
 * 
 * The state problem - handle expression expansion order problem
 * `handleExpressionExpansionMajor_impl` does 2 things to the token buffer:
 * 1. save it's own state
 * 2. expand the new expression - tokenlize the expression - push more token to the end of the token buffer
 * But the problem is, after major expression saved it's own state, the upper layer:
 * the `compileExpression_impl` layer also need to save it's own state, **before expanding the new expression**.
 * Solution: thanks to the state machine nature of this compiler, we can just put a global context struct that stores the required parameters for the
 * `handleExpressionExpansion_impl` call, update that context struct everytime before calling `compileMajorExpression_impl`, and cal`handleExpressionExpansion_impl` in `handleExpressionExpansionMajor_impl`
 * And for the `begin` case (`handleExpressionExpansionBegin_impl`) there's no need for it to be called before expansion,
 * since `handleExpressionExpansionBegin_impl` have nothing to do with the token buffer.
 * But notice that `handleExpressionExpansionMajorBegin_impl` still need to call `handleExpressionExpansion_impl`, since in the parent scope it mighbe in the middle
 * 
 * Note: all register pushed in the token buffer as register tokens, are becoming temporary registers, and have their lifetime managed by token buffer
 */
```

### Bug explaination
for example in the expression (10 - 2) * (3 + 4), it's considered as one major expression. and the first operand of this major expression is an expression, so it expands. in the handleExpressionExpansionMajorBegin_impl, i directly used the resultReg as the resultReg of the new expanding expression. since there's nothing before the first operand, overwriting it will not cause a problem, but will increase some performance and save register. But the current problem is that when the major expression resumes from the expansion, it set resultReg to itself, and then freed the resultReg, according to the register consuming logic. there are 2 ways i can think of to solve this conflict, one is create a new register in the handleExpressionExpansionMajorBegin_impl, another is adding an if check for self setting in the compileMajorExpression_impl.

### Today's progress
- Fixed yesterday's remianing bug
- Found more bugs and fixed them
- structure re-organize
- Implemented the `Evaluator`

## 2026-05-03 23:42:53:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: Complete TXCSL stage 1
After the completion of the `Compiler` and the `Evaluator`, and passed 22 test cases provided by `claude.ai`, the development of TXCSL engine finally reached to a mile stone.
Currently, the TXCSL engine can solve basic expressions, including bracket structures, variables, while remaining correct BODMAS sequences.

### Status
Development duration: 4.28 ~ 5.3 (6 days)
LOC(Lines of code): 1198

### Following TXCSL development goals
1. Variable write back - the assign operator
2. constant merge / constant pre-compute
3. special case of a major expr only having 1 or 2 entry
4. negative number and operator- ambiguity - IMPORTANT

## 2026-05-04 23:29:37:<br>Category: PCB Structure<br>Topic: Transistors: Toggling On and Off
*Use a small electrical signal (a electricity current with small voltage) to control a bigger current.*

Transistors are just on and off / high and low switches. They take in an electrical current, and output either 0 or that exact electrical current, depending on the controler signal (the *Gate*).
By connecting transistors, logic gates are made. By connecting logic gates, CPUs are made...
But in the most fundamental usage, transistors are just switches that toggles between high and low, on and off, 1 and 0...

### MOSFET
MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor) is a specialized transistor that's **voltage-controlled and solid-state.**
Just like explained above, it have 3 pins:
- **Gate**: The "controler" that controls either the output is high or low (Pin 1 in KiCad)
- **Drain**: The "output", will be either low or same as the input current (Pin 2 in KiCad)
- **Source**: The "input" (Pin 3 in KiCad)
**Typical Model in KiCad:** `IRF9540N`

In a P-Channel MOSFET, when *Gate* is low, *Drain* will be high; when *Gate* is high, *Drain* is low. (Kinda like a `NOT` if seen between *Gate* and *Drain*, or a `XOR` if seen in total)
In a N-Channel MOSFET, when *Gate* is high, *Drain* will be high; when *Gate* is low, *Drain* is low. (it's the opposite of P-Channel, it kinda like `AND` if seen in total)

The electrical current at *Gate* have to be either same with *Source*, or 0. Any voltage other than that will result in Linear Region (it's not fully on but not fully off either)

### NPN and PNP
NPN (Negative-Positive-Negative) and PNP (Positive-Negative-Positive) are 2 major types of Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT), that are **current-controlled**.
Just like explained above, they have 3 pins:
- **Emitter**: The "input" that supplies electrons (n-type) (Pin 1 in KiCad)
- **Base**: The "controler" that decide the output (p-type) (Pin 2 in KiCad)
- **Collector**: The"output" that will be high/low (n-type) (Pin 3 in KiCad)
**Typical Model in KiCad(NPN):** `2N3904`

NPN is similar to the N-Channel MOSFET, when *Base* is high, the *Collector* will be high; and vice versa.
PNP is similar to the P-Channel MOSFET, when *Base* is low, the *Collector* will be high; and vice versa.
*Logic is similar with MOSFET, but implementation (internal structure) is different*

Unlike MOSFET who need the voltage of *Gate* to be exactly the same with *Source*, for NPN and PNP, as long as there is electrical current at *Base* that can be detected, *Collector* will be high.

**Important Note**
NPN and PNP transistors have a voltage lost when electrical current go through them, *usually about 0.7V*.
Additionally, it will consume the current at *Base*, so remember to add resistor before the connection of *Base*.

## 2026-05-04 23:44:46:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: The USB-A connection
It's just straight forward connecting D+/D- to D+/D-, connecting SHIELD and GND to GND, and leaving VBUS not connecting, since the USB-A port is for keyboard, and I am targeting wireless keyboard... since the one I have is wireless.
If there's opportunity, I'll probably add power supply to it.

## 2026-05-04 23:43:36:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: The Power Buttom
It's an encapsulation of the ESP32 dev board's power button, since I don't what the user be pressing the dev board directly.
What it does is just controling the overall power supply of the dev board (the VIN), instead of talking to EN and IO0 (which actually does the exact same thing internally).

### Logic
`VBUS`: the raw input from the USB-C (5V)
`VIN`: the 5V input (output in this case)

---
First there's a P-Channel MOSFET Transistor. It has `VBUS` as it's *Source*, and `VIN` as it's *Drain*.
For the *Gate*, first there's the default state: `VBUS` connecting to it with a 10k resister, as a "pull up" that keep the *Gate* high so *Drain* is low.
Then there are 2 lines connecting to *Gate*, they both start from `GND`, and end at *Gate*.
These 2 are setted to be disconnect by default. But when they do connect, the *Gate* will be grounded and become low, then the *Drain* will be high.
For the first line, there's a push button. It is the "Power Button". When the button is pressed, the connection is completed, and *Gate* will be low.
For the second line, there's an NPN Transistor, who has its *Emiiter* be `GND`, and *Collector* be *Gate*.
The NPN Transistor is the "soft toggle" that can be controled by software.
It has its *Base* connecting to a GPIO pin with a 1k ~ 10k resister between. When the GPIO pin pulls high, the NPN Transistor will connect `GND` to *Gate*, pulling the *Drain* to be high.

---
So finally, whenever the power button is pressed down, VIN will be high, and the ESP32 will be booted. When booted, the GPIO pin that's connecting to the NPN Transister's *Base* have to be immediately setted to high, which then **"relay"** the high current of VIN.
And finally when the software need to shutdown, it set the GPIO pin to low, which then low the VIN.

### Note
Connect to VCC make the line high; connect to GND make the line low. When VCC and GND touches, GND wins.

## 2026-05-07 23:29:59:<br>Category: Personal Journal<br>Topic: Fighting Fusion 360 and Wine
Fusion 360 cannot run on arch.
This is the conclusion of this entire day.
To be honest, I almost did no work for the project today.
But in reality, all the time was spent fighting fusion and wine.
The problem is fairly simple: I have a very big problem using Windows, and I found myself cannot suffer under Windows for decent working.
Therefore, I was desperately trying to make Fusion 360 work on Linux.
For the first attempt, I found there's a github repo called "Autodesk-Fusion-360-for-Linux" (https://github.com/cryinkfly/Autodesk-Fusion-360-for-Linux).
At first glance, I tought that will be it.
But after I cloned the repo and tried the installation script, I soon find out that the repo is not made for arch, or at least, I couldn't get it working.
Then I start trying to launch Fusion 360 executable manually via directly using the `wine64` executable, since I had some experience using wine.
But the obsticles I ran into was "undefeatable": The Fusion 360 executable can be launched, but cannot talk to my browser, therefore cannot login.
My final attempt was to use the login URL from when I try to log in on Windows, and launch the `AdskIdentityManager.exe` with the login token (code) directly.
But the result was inexplicable. The log from `AdskIdentityManager.exe` showed that the token was valid, and the local port query also shows that the Fusion process is listening in a specific port that `AdskIdentityManager.exe` should send signal to. But for some unknown reason, when I launched the `AdskIdentityManager.exe` with the token and with the "success" log from it, the actual Fusion process does not respond anything.
At last, I tried installing it fresh on the Arch partition, but this time I couldn't even get the launching working.
So eventually after one day of trying, failure is my final conclusion.

## 2026-05-08 23:41:23:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: Separating TXCSL from the Software component system
After some examination of the code of TXCSL, it's scale and size already deserves it's own repository.
Additionally, I want to debug and test the code when I am working on TXCSL, but I could not run any code compiled by the esp-idf compiler, since I do not have the ESP32 chip yet.
During the first stage developemnt, I simply copied the code to my personal project's `main.cpp`, and editing it from there.
But as the scale gets bigger, I need to separate it into files.
Keeping it as one file, or one component who is to be copy and pasted everywhere is very not ideal.
Therefore, the desicion of separating it was made.
It would be an stand-alone C++ CMake project as a library, where a dummy project will be including it and testing it.
Once development is finished, the TXCSL lib will then be linked by the actual TXCompute project, and used as an engine, not an integrated internal logic class.

# 2026-05-09

## 2026-05-09 23:10:54:<br>Category: Documentation<br>Topic: TXCSL
TXCSL (TX Computational Scripting Language) is a bash-like, virtual machine based scripting language, which is capable of:
- Compute basic expressions
- Create variables
- Create functions

*TXCSL is targeting to be a DSL for computation. It is an enhancement of regular calculators, but not a turing complete programming language.*

TXCSL operates in the pipeline described below:
> **Every line of code will be *compiled* into instructions, then executed.**
Even the result appears instantly, it had been through the process of compilation.

## Interface Data Structs

```cpp
struct Expression {
	std::span<Command> commandBuffer; // the commands / instructions
	std::span<num> constantBuffer; // constant values that are involved in the expression
	std::span<num> variableBuffer; // variable values that are involved in the expression
	tx::u32 registerCount; // the required registers when evaluating
	tx::u32 commandCount; // the count of commands / instructions
};
```

```cpp
struct CompileResult {
	tx::u32 commandCount;
	tx::u32 constantCount;
	tx::u32 variableCount;
	std::vector<std::string_view> varibaleNames; // for the caller of compile() to fill in the variabe buffer
};
```

## Compilation

*There is the where the major processing logic of TXCSL is.*
Every line of code in TXCSL is treated as expression, and will be processed by the `tx::csl::Compiler`.

### The design pattern of the compilation
Each stage will have it's own class.
That class will be a temporary object, which will outputs a certain result of the stage.
The purpose of the class is to maintain it's own internal state (because they are all state machin design), and the temporary memory they allocate.

### Compilation pipeline
The compilation pipeline flow is:
1. Raw string
2. BracketParser - compose bracket structure
3. Tokenlizer    - tokenlize raw string. identify and convert value
4. Compiler      - transform tokens into instructions, flatten the operation tree
The process of nested expressions will be lazy, meaning that it will not be processed until necessary. 
When the Compiler encounters an unexpanded expression, it will call the Tokenlizer again, and tokenlize the unexpanded expression.

### Sketch
Click the sketch button, and select a surface.
That surface will act like the 2D plane that's being drew on.
The shapes will become 2D entities in a 3D space.

### Extrude
Make a shape into a body / 3d range.
Short cut: `E`
It can be making new bodies, appending to the old body it's physically connecting with / next to, or cut an area of bodies.

## 2026-05-10 22:30:17:<br>Category: CAD Design<br>Topic: Tolerance and Clearance
### Tolerance
**3D printing is not 100% accurate.**
It will have some difference then what the model is.
That difference it called ***Tolerance***. It's a value that the plus or minus of measurements can vary.
When designing CADs, the Tolerance have to be considerered in the measurements.
For example, when designing a hole for a `10mm` shaft targeting a tolerance of `0.2mm` 3d printing machine, the hole should have a diameter of `10.2mm` (ignoring clearance).
**The typical value of tolerance for 3D printing is `0.2mm` ~ `0.3mm`.**

### Clearance
It's the designed gap between parts to allow movement.
When you have a physical hole of `10mm` and a physical shaft of `10mm`, pretend values are exactly, they will not fit right through but get stuck together.
*Because friction of course.*
Therefore you need to add some space between the hole and the shaft, so that they can move.
The gold standard values are:
| | | |
|-|-|-|
`0.1 mm` | **The "Permanent" Fit.** | For parts that supposed to be hammered in and stuck together forever.
`0.2 mm` | **The "Mechanical" Fit.** | For parts that need to stay together but be removable by hand.
`0.3 mm` | **The "Moving" Fit.** | For parts that need to move freely like hinges and sliders.

## 2026-05-12 22:37:44:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: TXLib
### What TXLib is
https://github.com/TXWD1234/TXLib
TXLib is my (TX_Jerry's) personal library, that contains the utility helpers I made through out my C++ development.
I used TXLib for every project of mine after I created TXLib, and update TXLib through out the project development to add more features, or do some refactor, to make it better for future project.
So far, TXLib had already become somewhat like a formal library, where there are modules, components, architecture etc.
I always believe as the snow ball row bigger and bigger, with TXLib, I will maky my own development environment, and my development efficiency will be mush higher.

### TXLib in TXCompute the fallout project
As I use TXLib for every project of mine, TXCompute the fallout project is nor an expection.
Even if it's a hardware project, there is software part of it (and the software part is not small in my design).
Therefore TXLib is used and updated during the development of TXCompute.
Modules of TXLib I used in TXCompute:
- TXMath
- TXData
- TXUtility

## 2026-05-13 23:50:53:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: The design of The Shell - Hinge
The Shell (aka the 3D printed crust of the project) is now in production!

### Problem
The biggest problem of the shell design right now is the hinge between the Screen part and the MCU part.
I am targeting a laptop-like structure, which makes the hinge necessary, since I want a lid that can close and open freely.
Additionally, the wires for the screen frame data (in total of 14 wires: D0~D7, VCC, GND, DC, WR, CS, RST) have to somehow go through the hinge to connect to the screen as well.

### Solution
There will be 2 rectangular prism coming out from the MCU part of the shell (the bottom part), which is hollow inside.
They will have an horizontal through hole, that's parallel to the long edge of the shell.

The Screen Part of the shell (the top part) will be split into 3 parts, each are individual pieces. The separation line is at where each of the 2 hinges are located.
There will be a empty space in the location of each hinge, shared by the 2 parts from left and right.
Each part will have a hollow cylinder coming out, along the horizontal axis.
These cylinders will be inserted into the through hole of the rectangular prism from the MCU part, which created the hinge.

Every 7 wire can create a perfect hexagon shape (6 surrounding one), which evaluates to a diameter of 3mm, as if each wire has a 1mm diameter.
The inner hole of the cylinder from Screen Part need to contain this wire combination, therefore we can determind the inner diameter: `3mm + 0.4mm (tolerance) = 3.4mm.`
Then the Outer diameter: `3.4mm + 1mm * 2 (both side) = 5.4mm`.

As the through hole in the rectangular prism from the MCU part have to contain the cylinder, with enough clearance to move it around, but also not too loose, it's inner diameter can be determind as: `5.4mm + 0.4mm = 5.8mm`.
Then the outer diameter: `5.4mm + 1.5mm * 2 = 8.8mm`

Now for the empty gap of the Screen Part to fit the hinge:
*Measurements in the perspective of looking from one side of the Screen Part (front view)*
Depth and Height: Since we need to allow movement, and the radius ratio of the rotation is `(1 + √2) / 2`, therefore the depth / height is: `8.8mm * (1 + √2) / 2 = 10.6216mm -> 11mm`.
Width: The inner part of the rectangular prism is `3.4mm`, for the wire combination can fit through. Plus the necessary distance (`4mm`) for the mechanical hinge to be stable, roughly it's `11mm` as well. (The measurement here can be flexible)

And finally the dimension of the rectangular prism:
Height / Depth: `8.8mm` as the outer diameter of the though hole.
Width: `11mm - 2 * (0.2 (Tolerance) + 0.3 (Loose clearance)) = 10mm`
Horizontal Wall: `(10mm - 3.4) / 2 = 3.3mm`

# 2026-05-17

## 2026-05-17 23:42:45:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: TXLib refactor
During the development of the fallout project: TXCompute, I found a lot friction using my TXLib, primarily because of the CMake structure and inclusion friction.
Therefore, I decided to improve the installation pipeline of TXLib by a CMake refactor.
Here is the refactor report:

### New Architecture

#### Installation
- `add_txlib.cmake` is the general TXLib entry, which is independent with TXLib context (TXCMake).
  - Can be fetched with `curl` and then be included in the user's CMakeLists.txt directly.
- TXLib should only be added by `add_txlib.cmake`, or link the whole library by:
  ```cmake
  add_subdirectories(<path_to_txlib> <path_to_txlib_bin>)
  ```
- `add_txlib.cmake` only prepare the source of TXLib (either using local dir or fetching from github).
  - The linking of modules will be done by `add_txlib.cmake` calling TXLib's internal `link_txlib.cmake` script.
- There are files that set the parameter of TXLib installation. These files exist in `TXLib/TXCMake/installation/`, and all have prefix of `txlib_`.

##### The Pipeline
There are 3 stages to the installation pipeline:
1. Prepare source
   - in `add_txlib.cmake`
   - finished by `"TXLib: Sources are ready."`
   - use local dir or fetch from github
2. Resolve module list
   - in `TXCMake/installation/setup.cmake`
   - finished by `"TXLib: Modules: ..."`
3. Add modules
   - in `TXCMake/installation/setup.cmake`
   - finished by `"TXLib: Done adding TXLib."`
  
#### Modules
- All modules register their path in a `module_registry.cmake`. `setup_txlib.cmake` adds the components using `module_registry.cmake`.
  - Modules can have their module dir different from their module name.
  - All the registry variables are global with naming convension: prefix: `TXLib_${MODULE_NAME}_`.
  - The registry should include:
    - `TXLib_${moduleName}_SOURCE_DIR` Module Source Directory Path, relative to `${TXLib_SOURCE_DIR}/modules/`.
    - `TXLib_${moduleName}_DEPENDENCIES` Module Dependency within TXLib. Provide the module name: `TX...`.
    - `TXLib_MODULES` A list of all module names.
  - You can use `tx_module_registry_register()` helper in `module_registry_register.cmake` to do the registry. It will take care of all the above.
- All modules manage their own dependencies.
  - When a dependency from TXLib of the target module is not satisfied, the target module add the missing dependency module (in public scope).
- All modules will be declared by cmake function `tx_txlib_module()` in `txlib_module.cmake`.
  - When adding new modules, the registry file need to be updated.
  - After running function `tx_txlib_module()`, the cmake target will be created, and can be modified for things that `tx_txlib_module()` didn't account for, such as the external dependencies.

- render handler (Grid system and `TextRenderer`)

Several data structure need to be created:

## 2026-05-25 23:08:52:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: ESP `Buffer` Container
> *There have to be one day that I make this.*
The first day I saw `std::vector` I was thinking that.
And today is that day.
You see ESP environment introduces `heap_caps_malloc`, which makes the standard `std::vector`... kinda not that good.
Also, for my sepcific use case, I don't want it be able to expand, and I want to be able to set the heap caps attribute directly.
Therefore, making my own memory container is necessary.
And as a programmer that makes library, I thought why not put this in my library?
So... `tx::StaticGrowArr` emerges!
And by a simple wrapper `Buffer`, it fits the ESP envirnment perfectly!

# 2026-05-26

## 2026-05-26 22:27:29:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: `StringPool` - EvictingRingBuffer
This is one of the core infrastructure of the TerminalEngine.
It manages the string literals entered by the user, and manage them in a way such that when encountered overflow, the old data will be deleted to make space for new data.
This will be used to manage the input and output messages of the Terminal.

# 2026-05-27

## 2026-05-27 23:18:48:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: `LineBuffer`
`LineBuffer` is the buffer that contains the actual terminal lines.
Each entry of it is not a string, but a struct, consist of:
- index
- type
It could either be an entry in the `StringPool`, or a user defined message preset.
`StringPool`'s eviction will take affect on it, meanwhile itself will also evict when the lines reaches the maximum.
*So plus the internal 2 consideration of eviction in `StringPool`, this one is a 3 way invoker.*

# 2026-05-28

## 2026-05-28 23:49:16:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: Data Structure refactor
The previous buffers all uses one simple wrapper struct `Buffer<T>`, who wraps around `tx::StaticGrowArr<T>`.
That is a fragile design, because first `Buffer<T>` don't belong to mere TerminalEngine, second the orginal `tx::StaticGrowArr<T>` was holding way too many responsibility: both memory management and grow buffer logic.
Therefore today I refactored both `Buffer<T>` and `tx::StaticGrowArr<T>`:
- separate memory management from `tx::StaticGrowArr<T>`, created `tx::BasicStorage` class, which is just a simple heap memory manager;
- refactored `tx::StaticGrowArr<T>` to adopt the "overlay design pattern", where it don't manage memory, but only operate it.
- rename `tx::StaticGrowArr<T>` into `tx::GrowArrayOverlay<T>`
- refactored `Buffer<T>` into 2 parts: Contianer version of `tx::GrowArrayOverlay<T>` and Container version of `tx::CircularQueueOverlay<T>`

# 2026-05-29

## 2026-05-29 18:46:36:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: InputHandler Buffer design
Context: the input handler handles the input from `USBKeyboardInputHandler`. It provide a callback to `USBKeyboardInputHandler`, and in that callback it push the event data to a `CircularQueue` - the buffer.
And that buffer is supposed to be set by a higher end consumer, in this case the TerminalEngine. The consumer will read and parse the event data in the buffer periodically, once may consume multiple elements.
The problem I am deciding right now is how does the consumer read the data, and how to handle the circular logic.
There are 3 function provided by the `CircularQueue` - the buffer we are using here, that is related with the problem:
- `push()` add one element at the end of the buffer. if the size ptr reached the end, it will wraps around to the start.
- `pop()` delete the last element. if the last element is at the end, it will unwrap the wrapped buffer.
- `full()` check if buffer is full: begin == end.
I currently have 2 options to consider: *(potentially there are better solutions that I don't know)*
First, let the InputHandler's callback do the heavy lifting, check `full()` before every `push()`, if true then `pop()` - essentially making a ring buffer. And the consumer will track an index of the previous read element, and update it everytime it read. This index can either have an if wrapping it, or perform a modulo for every query.
This method would require me to implement random access, or for_each from an index in `CircularQueue`, and the exception will be very subtle, since when the consumer thread stale, the producer might go a full circle in that `CircularQueue` and input will be completly currupted silently. The benefit of it is that it's perfectly thread safe, the `CircularQueue` object is only being operated by the `InputHandler`.
Second, the `InputHandler` only `push()`, and when the consumer consumes data, it calls `pop()`. When `InputHandler` detects `full()`: excpetion: main thread is staling.
This method is the simplest, and have an explicit exception. But it makes 2 threads operate `CircularQueue` potentially at the same time.

### Final Decision
After analyze, I choosed the second option, but with an additional detail:
**Use `std::mutex`.**
All the thread problem can be easily solved by `std::mutex`, and since we are not preformance bounded here, there is no overhead of using thread locks.
And since the thread problem is not in consideration, the simplest solution wins.

## 2026-05-30 23:38:42:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: The First 3D Printing Test
Today is the first time my TXCompute Shell got actually printed out in real life.
Seeing the 3D model appears in real life makes a lot of things different.
The first problem I encountered is that a lot of places where I designed to have screws, don't have place for human to operate. The space I left is way to small that neither a human hand nor any tools can fit in.
Another realization is that the tolerance in real life is much bigger then the calculations. The effect of clearance was far from the expectation, and a lot of mathematically sound designs crashes against reality.
Therefore, my TXCompute Shell design need a refactor too...
*Omg im gen drowning in the ocean of refactor....*

## 2026-05-31 13:30:47:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: The Terminal Text Grid
The pixel canvas of the terminal is `480x320`. 
Each character will have a size of `10x20`, forming a text grid of `48x16`.

## 2026-05-31 21:08:37:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: The Font Data for Terminal
Because of the limited storage of ESP32, the font data is stored in bitmap, bit packed as one bit is one pixel.
The font data is in the form of a C array in hex with type `u8`, in a header file, along with a `size_t` constant containing the size of the font data, all in `constexpr const`.
The header file will be included by the user of the font.

### Generating the Font Data
**1. Extract picture from ttf**
A python script is used to perform this operation.
```python
import os
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont

FONT_PATH = "/usr/share/fonts/noto/NotoSansMono-Regular.ttf"  # Change to your actual font file path
OUTPUT_DIR = "grid_glyphs_bit"
TARGET_WIDTH = 10
TARGET_HEIGHT = 20

# 14px to 16px ensures the entire span from top of 'M' to bottom of 'g' fits in 20px
FONT_SIZE = 14 

os.makedirs(OUTPUT_DIR, exist_ok=True)

try:
    font = ImageFont.truetype(FONT_PATH, FONT_SIZE)
except IOError:
    print(f"Error: Could not load font at {FONT_PATH}")
    exit(1)

# --- 1. Calculate Global Font Metrics ---

**2. Compile the picture files into bit-packed binary**
An C++ program is used to perform this operation.
```cpp
int main() {

	std::vector<tx::u8> buffer(1);

	fs::path dir = "/home/TX_Jerry/temp/FalloutFontToImage/grid_glyphs_bit";
	for (tx::u32 i = 32; i < 127; i++) {
		tx::Image img(dir / (std::to_string(i) + ".png"));
		if (!img.valid()) {
			return 0;
		}
		tx::u32 bitCounter = 0;
		std::span<tx::u8> imgspan = img.span();
		for (int j = 0; j < 200; j++) {
			if (bitCounter == 0) buffer.push_back(0);
			tx::bit::setIndex(buffer.back(), bitCounter, imgspan[j * 4 + 3] < 140 ? tx::u8{ 0 } : tx::u8{ 1 });
			bitCounter++;
			if (bitCounter == 8) {
				bitCounter = 0;
			}
		}
	}

	std::ofstream ofs(dir.parent_path() / "font", std::ios::binary);
	ofs.write(reinterpret_cast<char*>(buffer.data()), buffer.size());

	return 0;
}
```

**3. Convert binary file into C array source file**
CLI tool `xxd` is used to perform this operation.
```bash
xxd -i Font Font.h
```

## 2026-05-28 23:48:20:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: Input Pipeline of TerminalEngine
*Input refer to the input from the user of the terminal - the input from the keyboard.*
*All following class type identifier default refer to classes in namespace `tx::terminal`. aka `using namespace tx::terminal`.*

### InputHandler
The source of input of the Terminal Engine is the keyboard, specificly the `tx::esp::USBKeyboardInputHandler` from TXESP_Infrastructure.
The `tx::esp::USBKeyboardInputHandler` has a callback based input system, and that's not ideal for complex logic, because the callback is happened in a system level loop, which staling might cause problem.
Therefore, `InputHandler` is created. It provide `tx::esp::USBKeyboardInputHandler` a callback, which will push input event entries to a buffer provided by the `TerminalEngine`. It flattens the input stream, such that the Terminal Engine can perform complex logic in async while not staling the system driver.

### `TerminalEngine::poll()`
This is a public API called by the user - in the program sense - the higher layer of the TerminalEngine, which is the TXCompute main class.
`poll()` is the main entry of the async processing pipeline. When this function is called, the caller should expect the possibility of thge input callback be called, and old references to the user input string to be invalidated (as they are stored in the `StringPool` of the TerminalEngine, which might delete some string entries to make free space for new spaces).
If `poll()` is not called for a long period of time, an exception might happen in the InputHandler, because the input buffer of the Terminal Engine is filled up. To prevent this, a pair of `stale()` / `unstale()` API is provided in `InputHandler` to ignore the input from source.
`poll()` copies the current input entries, and pop them from the buffer.
After that, the lock is released, and the processing of input begins.
`handleInputEvent_impl()` is called for every input event. Each input event is one key pressing, repeative pressing down, or releasing.

### `TerminalEngine::handleInputEvent_impl()`
Process one key input event. It could be either pressing, repeative pressing down, or releasing.
If releasing, the event will be ignored.
Otherwise, if the key is printable, it will go through modifier modifications beforehand (such as CapsLock and Shift), and then be pushed into `InputLine` as a `char`.
If the key is non-printable, aka a function key, it will be processed in a `swtich`, determinding what action it is doing.
In this stage, all operations are operations of `InputLine`, except `Enter`, which triggers `handleNewLine_impl()`.

### InputLine
Using a classic head-tail / front-back 2 buffer design, The InputLine class handles the storage of the current one line input.
It separates the 2 buffer by the current cursor position. And entering an new character is push_back on the front buffer, pressing delete key is pop_back of the back buffer.
It provides APIs for basic text operation such as moving the cursor and enter / deleting characters.
InputLine also provide `output` function to write the current stored string into a `std::span<char>`.

### `TerminalEngine::handleNewLine_impl`
It extracts the input string and store it in the StringPool.
Then then line buffer will be updated, potentialy triggering eviction: `lineBufferEvict_impl()`.
Finally, the input callback will be called with the input string stored in StringPool.

### Line buffer
Stores the information of each line. Separated by `'\n'`.
It is a CircularQueue of type `Line_impl`.

**Line_impl**
A line could be either an entry in the `StringPool` or a string that's outside of the TerminalEngine.
There is only one u32 value in this struct. It could either be a `u32` id in the `StringPool`, or a `const char*` pointer since on 32 bit architecture a pointer is 4 bytes.
The last bit is used as the boolean flag to identify whether it's an id *(1)* or a pointer *(0)*.

**`lineBufferEvict_impl()`**
The line buffer is obviously fixed sized and will obviously fill up. If line buffer is filled up, but non of StringPool's buffer is filled up, the eviction of line buffer will trigger.
It will first pop the last element of the line buffer - of course.
Then, it will try to communicate to StringPool, and delete the stored string that is corresponding to this deleting line entry, **if** this line entry is a id type.

### The double lock between Line Buffer Eviction and StringPool Eviction
Because LineBuffer and StringPool are both ring buffer design, they all have possibility to trigger an eviction.
And the eviction need to sync with each other to prevent currupted data.
Therefore in `TerminalEngine` there is a `m_state`, that contains 2 boolean flags, which are used for the 2 eviction to declare their state.
If one eviction is happening, and it calles the other eviction, the other eviction will not trigger the eviction back again: the infinite recursion loop is prevented by an if check.

## 2026-06-02 21:42:00:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: `RingBuffer`
I've been avoiding implementing a complete ring buffer data structure.. for whatevery reason.
But now in the render pipeline, a standard ring buffer for the cache is essential. *Even though it's only 16 elements? Yeah im just making excuses to make data structures.*
Therefore... my favourite time! Add new data structure! The library must grow!

## 2026-06-02 21:42:53:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: Output Pipeline of TerminalEngine
Building on top of the already established foundation of lineBuffer, the output pipeline is really simple:
- 2 APIs, one for dynamic output, and one for static output - perfectly handled by the `Line_impl` dual-type mechanism (guess why i designed it like that?)
- for static output, it's simply constructing a `Line_impl` with the provided pointer and push into the line buffer
- for dynamic output, it's just one more step then static: put the string in StringPool, and then push the ID into line buffer
Simple!

# 2026-06-04

## 2026-06-04 21:35:13:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: Render Pipeline of TerminalEngine
The render pipeline of the TerminalEngine consists of 4 parts:
- lhCache (line height cache) book keeping
- render state and cursor logic
- render events
- drawing characters and lines

### Terminology:
| Word | Explaination |
|-|-|
Logical Line / Line_impl | the entry in lineBuffer, that represents one line without wrapping
Screen Line / Render Line | the actual displaying line of text on the screen, consider wrapping

### lhCache
Front is top (of the screen); Back is bottom (of the screen)
Stores the height (screen line count) of every logical line that are visible on the screen.
It's index is linearly parallel to lineBuffer, meaning that the second entry in lhCache is corresponding to:
```cpp
m_lineBuffer[m_lhCacheState.topLine + 1]
```
lhCache represent the current display state, which serve for the scrolling logic.

#### `m_lhCacheState`
```cpp
struct LhCacheState_impl {
	/**
	 * topLine is index of the first Line_impl that is visible on
	 * the screen. It is also the index of Line_impl that the front() of
	 * lhCache is according to.
	 * topLineBegin is the index of the screen line that is the
	 * actual first line on the screen. it is the index within the range
	 * of the topLine object
	 */
	u32 topLine, topLineBegin, bottomLineEnd;
	/**
	 * the total amount of screen lines of all the logical lines that are
	 * currently visible on screen, including the invisible screen lines of
	 * the top and bottom logical line
	 */
	u32 screenLineCount;
} m_lhCacheState;
```

It is necessary to update screenLineCount whenever a push or pop to the lhCache happened.

### RenderState
```cpp
struct RenderState_impl {
	/**
	 * cursorPos always points to the end of left buffer (exclusively), and
	 * points to the begin of right buffer (inclusively).
	 * Speaking in plain english: cursorPos is the first character of right
	 * buffer, which is also the character behind the last character of
	 * left buffer
	 */
	Coord cursorPos;
} m_renderState;
```
*Yeah an entire struct just to store one Coord. It's all for good practice trust.*

Cursor will wrap to the begining if moved horizontally to the end.

### Render events
Event functions that have their name directly matching with the keyboard action event. *encapsulating inside encapsulation.*
The `handleInputEvent_impl` will call these event functions, which will perform their logic and update the graphics.

### Drawing
Consist of simple grid -> pixel converter, line drawer and full redraw function

## 2026-06-05 23:37:15:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: The great pitfall of minor optimization
I was being smart the whole time when I was making the rest of the Terminal Engine, but when it came to my favourite rendering pipeline, I made a big architectual mistake.
And it is almost the worse architectual mistake I could ever make: **Minor Optimization**. Specificly, make an minor optimization driven architectual design.
Just like you can clearly tell in the source code, abruptly from the rest of the terminal engine, the rendering pipeline, driven by `lhCache`, is unexpected fragile and complex.
All of that complexity trade only for the performance of recomputing the height of each line every scrolling - which is just one integer division each.
And by creating a cache for that, I officially invented ***State Machine Spaghetti***. There are way to many state variables to maintain, let alone the update complexity is probably already greater then purely SIMD the recomputation.
And by the way, a cache takes more memory! So that also violated my initial design idea of memory aware.
So yeah... that was a failure. But at least currently the logic seems to be working.
Because shipping is more important then performance optimization, following "Make it work before make it fast" rule (*I probably already violated it for like twenty times*), I am not going to refactor it.
As long as it works, it works.

# 2026-06-06

## 2026-06-06 21:02:42:<br>Category: Development Report<br>Topic: Completion of TerminalEngine
Yesterday, the core logic of the TerminalEngine is completed.
But it is still way to plain and featureless.
Therefore today the new features I added to the engine makes it truely production ready.
*Okay at this point I'm just making excuses for being not productive today.*
And the next step will be writing the focumentation of TerminalEngine and TXCSL, and the complete the main class of TXCompute. Finally, finalize the 3D CAD model, and then I'm ready to submit.
Hopefully I can build the project before the deadline.
Good luck!
*Why am I literally saying good luck to myself.*

# 2026-06-07

## 2026-06-07 20:58:27:<br>Category: Documentation<br>Topic: TerminalEngine Documentation
The Terminal Engine is a text render and input processor, that performs resemble a terminal.
It is designed targeting specificly for memory constrained environment, such as the embedded system environment in ESP32, following the KISS rule (Keep It Simple, Stupid).

---
Logics are separated into different classes, each with their own logic to consider: *"Do one thing and do it well"*.
Then the overall class `TemrinalEngine` combines all of the sub-logic classes into a set of uniform terminal APIs.

With that architecture in mind, there are 3 sub classes:
- `StringPool`
- `InputLine`
- `InputHandler`
And an overall class: `TerminalEngine`, which consist of 3 logical parts:
- Line Storage
- Input Pipeline
- Render Pipeline

### `StringPool`
The `StringPool` is a specialized implementation of an ring buffer.
There are 2 more features that it achieved beyond the classic ring buffer:
- Data entry grouping
- Automatic eviction

#### Data Layout
`m_data`: the buffer that stores the actual data
`m_meta`: the buffer that stores the meta data of each logical data group (object): where it start and how big is it.

#### Terminology:
> - Evict:
>   The operation of deleting old data to make space for incoming new data when buffer is full. The deleted data is always the oldest data, and one evition might delete multiple data entry depending on the condition
> - Object / Meta / Range:
>   These terms refers to an entry in `m_meta`, which is corresponding to a range of data in `m_data`. Conceptually simillar to a partition. In the case of the StringPool, it is a string.

#### Data Entry Grouping
Each object consist of one or more entry in `m_data`, and they are grouped together by logic. They are added to the buffer at the same time, and deleted together when eviction happens.
Because the size of each object is variadic, some object might be much bigger then others, or they might all have size of 1.

#### Automatic Eviction
The total memory usage of `StringPool` is fixed at construction. There are no runtime allocation after initialization.
Therefore, the size of `m_meta` and `m_data` are both fixed. Because the data entry grouping mechanism, especially because the variadic size, both `m_meta` and `m_data` have a potential of becomeing full.
Hence, there are 2 condition to invoke an eviction: `m_meta` is full or `m_data` is full.
In the case of MetaEviction (`m_meta` is full), the oldest and only the oldest object need to be deleted.
In the case of MemoryEviction (`m_data` is full), a range of objects need to be deleted, since the incoming object might have a size that is bigger then the oldest object.
Both evictions have a potential of leaving interspace (memory gap) between the oldest object and the second oldest object, since the incoming object's size might be smaller then size of the evicted object(s).

### `InputLine`
`InputLine` is a classic "gap buffer" inputer design, that provide APIs for the `TerminalEngine` to perform standard input actions (such as moving cursor, input characters, and deleting characters). It also provide a set of APIs for the `TerminalEngine` to query it's internal state and get the final inputed string when user finishes inputing.

#### Logic
There are 2 buffers in `InputLine`, each one has the capacity of the maximum length of one line in the terminal (which is set by `TerminalEngine`).
They are the left and right buffers. Intuitively, they stores characters to the left / right of the cursor.
Whenever a character is inputed, the char value is pushed to the back of the left buffer.
Whenever the cursor move left, the back element of left buffer (`left.back()`) is pushed to the back of right buffer. And vice versa for moving right.
The layout can be displayed like this:
```
Normal buffer:
[<<buf<<]
^       ^
front   back

InputLine's Gap Buffer:
[<<left<<]     |       [>>right>>]
^        ^     ^       ^         ^
front    back  cursor  back      front
```

### `InputHandler`
`inputHandler` is a wrapper of `tx::esp::USBKeyboardInputHandler` from TXESP_Infrastructure.
It convert the event callback style input into flattened buffer input, which can be easily parsed by `TerminalEngine`.

#### Reason
`tx::esp::USBKeyboardInputHandler` has a callback based input system, and that's not ideal for complex logic, because the callback is happened in a system level loop, which staling might cause problem.
Therefore, `InputHandler` is created. It provide `tx::esp::USBKeyboardInputHandler` a callback, which will push input event entries to a buffer provided by the `TerminalEngine`. It flattens the input stream, thereby the Terminal Engine can perform complex logic in async while not staling the system driver.

#### Logic
The buffer that holds the flattened input event data is the most complicated part of this sub-system.
Essentially, it is a ring buffer, that wraps around to the front when reached the back.
`TerminalEngine` and `InputHandler` share a same object of `tx::CircularQueue`. `InputHandler` push new element to the buffer when a new event happens; `TerminalEngine` read and delete the entries it read every update, creating a perfect producer-consumer cycle.
As long as `TemrinalEngine` don't stale while InputHandler is not `stale()`ed, the ring buffer will not collide.

### Line Storage
*Also know as LineBuffer.*

Stores the information of each line. Separated by `'\n'`.
It is a CircularQueue of type `Line_impl`.

#### Line_impl
A line could be either an entry in the `StringPool` or a string that's outside of the `TerminalEngine` (not owned by `TerminalEngine`).
There is only one u32 value in this struct. It could either be a `u32` id in the `StringPool`, or a `const char*` pointer since on 32 bit architecture a pointer is 4 bytes.
The last bit is used as the boolean flag to identify whether it's an id *(1)* or a pointer *(0)*.
*All of these just to save memory.*

#### `lineBufferEvict_impl()`
The line buffer is obviously fixed sized and will obviously fill up. If line buffer is filled up, but non of `StringPool`'s buffer is filled up, the eviction of line buffer will trigger. *Which is also know as LineBufferEviction. (following the naming convension of `StringPool`)*
It will first pop the last element of the line buffer, then try to communicate to `StringPool`, and delete the stored string that is corresponding to this deleting line entry, **if** this line entry is a id type.
*So in conclusion, this entire line buffer structure is a 3 way eviction system.*

#### `handleDeleteEvent_impl()`
This function is the callback function of `StringPool`. It handles the job of syncing the state of `StringPool` with lineBuffer.
Whenever a string (aka an object in StringPool terminology) is deleted, the corresponding line must be deleted as well.
Therefore, `lineBufferEvict_impl()` is called. And since meanwhile a line could also be an external string that don't belong to `StringPool`, a string pool eviction might invoke the deletion of multiple lines, since deletion must happen in chronological order, also since the line from `StringPool` must be delete, every line before the first `StringPool` line must be deleted as well.

#### The double lock between Line Buffer Eviction and StringPool Eviction
Because LineBuffer and StringPool are both ring buffer design, they all have possibility to trigger an eviction.
And the eviction need to sync with each other to prevent currupted data.
Since `handleDeleteEvent_impl()` calls `lineBufferEvict_impl()`, and `lineBufferEvict_impl()` also indirectly calls `handleDeleteEvent_impl()` by deleteing object from `StringPool`, a cycle is created. If not interrupted, an infinite recursive loop will stale everything.
Therefore in `TerminalEngine` there is a `m_state`, who contains 2 boolean flags, which are used for the 2 eviction to declare their state.
If one eviction is happening, and it calles the other eviction, the other eviction will not trigger the eviction back again: the infinite recursion loop is prevented by an if check.

### Input Pipeline

#### `TerminalEngine::poll()`
This is a public API called by the user - in the program sense - the higher layer of the TerminalEngine, which is the TXCompute main class.
`poll()` is the main entry of the async processing pipeline. When this function is called, the caller should expect the possibility of the input callback be called, and old references to the user input string to be invalidated (as they are stored in the `StringPool` of the TerminalEngine, which might delete some string entries to make free space for new spaces).
If `poll()` is not called for a long period of time, an exception might happen in the InputHandler, because the input buffer of the Terminal Engine is filled up. To prevent this, a pair of `stale()` / `unstale()` API is provided in `InputHandler` to ignore the input from source. ***You only need to manually call them if stale is planed to happen during input session.***
`poll()` copies the current input entries, and pop them from the buffer.
After that, the lock is released, and the processing of input begins.
`handleInputEvent_impl()` is called for every input event. Each input event is one key pressing, repeative pressing down, or releasing.

#### `TerminalEngine::handleInputEvent_impl()`
Process one key input event. It could be either pressing, repeative pressing down, or releasing.
If releasing, the event will be ignored.
Otherwise, if the key is printable, it will go through modifier modifications beforehand (such as CapsLock and Shift), and then be pushed into `InputLine` as a `char`.
If the key is non-printable, aka a function key, it will be processed in a `swtich`, determinding what action it is doing.
In this stage, all operations are methods of `InputLine`, except `Enter`, which triggers `handleNewLine_impl()`.

#### `TerminalEngine::handleNewLine_impl`
First it extracts the input string from `InputLine` and store it in the StringPool.
Then line buffer will be updated, potentialy triggering eviction: `lineBufferEvict_impl()`.
Finally, the input callback will be called with the input string stored in StringPool.

#### Sessions
There are 2 sessions in the terminal engine:
**Input Session:**
Start when `startInputSession()` is called.
End when terminal user presses enter or `endInputSession()` is called.
During input session, all `print()` will be ignored (including `printStatic()`), and inputHandler will be `unstale()`ed.

Default session. Start when TerminalEngine object is initiated, or input session had ended.
End when input session had started or TerminalEngine object is destroied.
During output session, all terminal user input will be ignored, and `print()` will be allowed.

### Render Pipeline
The render pipeline of the TerminalEngine consists of 4 parts:
- lhCache (line height cache) book keeping
- render state and cursor logic
- render events
- drawing characters and lines

#### Terminology:
| Word | Explaination |
|-|-|
Logical Line / Line_impl | the entry in lineBuffer, that represents one line without wrapping
Screen Line / Render Line | the actual displaying line of text on the screen, consider wrapping

#### lhCache
Front is top (of the screen); Back is bottom (of the screen)
Stores the height (screen line count) of every logical line that are visible on the screen.
It's index is linearly parallel to lineBuffer, meaning that the second entry in lhCache is corresponding to:
```cpp
m_lineBuffer[m_lhCacheState.topLine + 1]
```
lhCache represent the current display state, which serve for the scrolling logic.

##### `m_lhCacheState`
```cpp
struct LhCacheState_impl {
	/**
	 * topLine is index of the first Line_impl that is visible on
	 * the screen. It is also the index of Line_impl that the front() of
	 * lhCache is according to.
	 * topLineBegin is the index of the screen line that is the
	 * actual first line on the screen. it is the index within the range
	 * of the topLine object
	 */
	u32 topLine, topLineBegin, bottomLineEnd;
	/**
	 * the total amount of screen lines of all the logical lines that are
	 * currently visible on screen, including the invisible screen lines of
	 * the top and bottom logical line
	 */
	u32 screenLineCount;
} m_lhCacheState;
```

It is necessary to update screenLineCount whenever a push or pop to the lhCache happened.

#### RenderState
```cpp
struct RenderState_impl {
	/**
	 * cursorPos always points to the end of left buffer (exclusively), and
	 * points to the begin of right buffer (inclusively).
	 * Speaking in plain english: cursorPos is the first character of right
	 * buffer, which is also the character behind the last character of
	 * left buffer
	 */
	Coord cursorPos;
} m_renderState;
```
*Yeah an entire struct just to store one Coord. It's all for good practice trust.*

Cursor will wrap to the begining if moved horizontally to the end.

#### Render events
Event functions that have their name directly matching with the keyboard action event. *encapsulating inside encapsulation.*
The `handleInputEvent_impl` will call these event functions, which will perform their logic and update the graphics.

#### Drawing
Consist of simple grid -> pixel converter, line drawer and full redraw function

## 2026-06-08 23:36:26:<br>Category: Personal Journal<br>Topic: Intellisense crashout
Yeah... now for the entire fallout project, my CMake and Intellisense are just not working. Even I already utilized `compile_command.json` it's still not doing it's job. It's appearing that all the inclusion for external libraries, in this case my TXLib, are not recognized by Intellisense.
I've tried everything I could, no positive result or even any progress was made.
Then I guess I need to work without intellisense and with red squiggles over everything now.
Maybe I should be graceful for this thing not breaking when I was in the actual intense development?

# 2026-06-09

## 2026-06-09 21:38:45:<br>Category: Documentation<br>Topic: TextRenderer
TextRenderer is the highest level interface of the rendering pipeline, that is based off of the ILI9488 driver and ESP_LCD.
The dependency tree:
```
TextRenderer
FrameComposer
ILI9488DriverPanel
ESP_LCD
```

#### `ILI9488DriverPanel`
*This Driver is made according to the data sheet: https://www.hpinfotech.ro/ILI9488.pdf*
*It's basically just a wrapper of the io system.*
ILI9488DriverPanel manage the lowest level communication between the higher level firmware and the LCD screen hardware.
It has stores the commands to the hardware, and specificly focuses on these two jobs:
- Initialization of the LCD screen;
- Write data to specific location of the LCD screen's framebuffer.
Call `ILI9488DriverPanel::init()` to initialize; Call `ILI9488DriverPanel::draw()` to write pixels.

#### `FrameComposer`
Manage the bus and io, and also wraps around the `ILI9488DriverPanel`, bringing the render process one level higher.
It takes care of the transformation of the pixel data, manage the lifetime of the bus and io provided by ESP_LCD.
`FrameComposer` is the end of talking to hardware APIs. It fully wraps the configuration and initialization, leaving only an API `draw(Coord topLeft, Coord dimension, u16* data)` for the software to perform the rendering.

#### `TextRenderer`
Manage the pixel data, consists of a simple double buffer design, and the job of unpacking the bit-packed character data.
`TextRenderer` abstract the rendering pipeline one step furthur, now the software don't need to thing about the actual pixel data anymore, instead only the character that is being drawed need to be considered.
*This class is technically a software as it does not use hardware APIs directly, but I still considered it as firmware because it is such a low level component.*

#### Font
Because of the limited storage of ESP32, the font data is stored in bitmap, bit packed as one bit is one pixel.
The font data is in the form of a C array in hex with type `u8`, in a header file, along with a `size_t` constant containing the size of the font data, all in `constexpr const`.
The header file will be included by the user of the font.

The font file used in this project is generated by a 2 stage pipeline:
- convert ttf file into png file via a python script
- read the png image file and pack the color into bits via a C++ program

*I genuinely didn't thought the power button will be this complicated.*




### Header List
1. GND
2. VBUS (5V input)
3. VIN (5V output)
4. POWER (GPIO)
5. PWR_SIG (GPIO)
6. BTN_LEFT (connect to one side of the push button)
7. BTN_RIGHT (connect to one side of the push button)





Todo:
add set pin in FrameComposer



lights: backlights - brightness and power usage
